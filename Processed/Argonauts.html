<div class="divBody">
<p class="first xd26e219">By Sir James G. Frazer</p>
<p>My esteemed friend, Dr. B. Malinowski has asked me to write a
preface to his book, and I willingly comply with his request, though I
can hardly think that any words of mine will add to the value of the
remarkable record of anthropological research which he has given us in
this volume. My observations, such as they are, will deal partly with
the writer&rsquo;s method and partly with the matter of his book.</p>
<p>In regard to method, Dr. Malinowski has done his work, as it appears
to me, under the best conditions and in the manner calculated to secure
the best possible results. Both by theoretical training and by
practical experience he was well equipped for the task which he
undertook. Of his theoretical training he had given proof in his
learned and thoughtful treatise on the family among the aborigines of
Australia<a class="noteref" id="xd26e235src" href="#xd26e235" name=
"xd26e235src">1</a>; of his practical experience he had produced no
less satisfactory evidence in his account of the natives of Mailu in
New Guinea, based on a residence of six months among them.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e240src" href="#xd26e240" name="xd26e240src">2</a> In
the Trobriand Islands, to the east of New Guinea, to which he next
turned his attention, Dr. Malinowski lived as a native among the
natives for many months together, watching them daily at work and at
play, conversing with them in their own tongue, and deriving all his
information from the surest sources&mdash;personal observation and
statements made to him directly by the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"xd26e246" href="#xd26e246" name="xd26e246">viii</a>]</span>natives in
their own language without the intervention of an interpreter. In this
way he has accumulated a large mass of materials, of high scientific
value, bearing on the social, religious, and economic or industrial
life of the Trobriand Islanders. These he hopes and intends to publish
hereafter in full; meantime he has given us in the present volume a
preliminary study of an interesting and peculiar feature in Trobriand
society, the remarkable system of exchange, only in part economic or
commercial, which the islanders maintain among themselves and with the
inhabitants of neighbouring islands.</p>
<p>Little reflection is needed to convince us of the fundamental
importance of economic forces at all stages of man&rsquo;s career from
the humblest to the highest. After all, the human species is part of
the animal creation, and as such, like the rest of the animals, it
reposes on a material foundation; on which a higher life, intellectual,
moral, social, may be built, but without which no such superstructure
is possible. That material foundation, consisting in the necessity of
food and of a certain degree of warmth and shelter from the elements,
forms the economic or industrial basis and prime condition of human
life. If anthropologists have hitherto unduly neglected it, we may
suppose that it was rather because they were attracted to the higher
side of man&rsquo;s nature than because they deliberately ignored and
undervalued the importance and indeed necessity of the lower. In excuse
for their neglect we may also remember that anthropology is still a
young science, and that the multitude of problems which await the
student cannot all be attacked at once, but must be grappled with one
by one. Be that as it may, Dr. Malinowski has done well to emphasise
the great significance of primitive economics by singling out the
notable exchange system of the Trobriand Islanders for special
consideration.</p>
<p>Further, he has wisely refused to limit himself to a mere
description of the processes of the exchange, and has set himself to
penetrate the motives which underlie it and the feelings which it
excites in the minds of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e252"
href="#xd26e252" name="xd26e252">ix</a>]</span>natives. It appears to
be sometimes held that pure sociology should confine itself to the
description of acts and should leave the problems of motives and
feelings to psychology. Doubtless it is true that the analysis of
motives and feelings is logically distinguishable from the description
of acts, and that it falls, strictly speaking, within the sphere of
psychology; but in practice an act has no meaning for an observer
unless he knows or infers the thoughts and emotions of the agent; hence
to describe a series of acts, without any reference to the state of
mind of the agent, would not answer the purpose of sociology, the aim
of which is not merely to register but to understand the actions of men
in society. Thus sociology cannot fulfil its task without calling in at
every turn the aid of psychology.</p>
<p>It is characteristic of Dr. Malinowski&rsquo;s method that he takes
full account of the complexity of human nature. He sees man, so to say,
in the round and not in the flat. He remembers that man is a creature
of emotion at least as much as of reason, and he is constantly at pains
to discover the emotional as well as the rational basis of human
action. The man of science, like the man of letters, is too apt to view
mankind only in the abstract, selecting for his consideration a single
side of our complex and many-sided being. Of this one-sided treatment
Moli&egrave;re is a conspicuous example among great writers. All his
characters are seen only in the flat: one of them is a miser, another a
hypocrite, another a coxcomb, and soon; but not one of them is a man.
All are dummies dressed up to look very like human beings; but the
likeness is only on the surface, all within is hollow and empty,
because truth to nature has been sacrificed to literary effect. Very
different is the presentation of human nature in the greater artists,
such as Cervantes and Shakespeare: their characters are solid, being
drawn not from one side only but from many. No doubt in science a
certain abstractness of treatment is not merely legitimate, but
necessary, since science is nothing but knowledge raised to the highest
power, and all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e256" href="#xd26e256"
name="xd26e256">x</a>]</span>knowledge implies a process of abstraction
and generalisation: even the recognition of an individual whom we see
every day is only possible as the result of an abstract idea of him
formed by generalisation from his appearances in the past. Thus the
science of man is forced to abstract certain aspects of human nature
and to consider them apart from the concrete reality; or rather it
falls into a number of sciences, each of which considers a single part
of man&rsquo;s complex organism, it may be the physical, the
intellectual, the moral, or the social side of his being; and the
general conclusions which it draws will present a more or less
incomplete picture of man as a whole, because the lines which compose
it are necessarily but a few picked out of a multitude.</p>
<p>In the present treatise Dr. Malinowski is mainly concerned with what
at first sight might seem a purely economic activity of the Trobriand
Islanders; but, with his usual width of outlook and fineness of
perception, he is careful to point out that the curious circulation of
valuables, which takes place between the inhabitants of the Trobriand
and other islands, while it is accompanied by ordinary trade, is by no
means itself a purely commercial transaction; he shows that it is not
based on a simple calculation of utility, of profit and loss, but that
it satisfies emotional and &aelig;sthetic needs of a higher order than
the mere gratification of animal wants. This leads Dr. Malinowski to
pass some severe strictures on the conception of the Primitive Economic
Man as a kind of bogey who, it appears, still haunts economic
text-books and even extends his blighting influence to the minds of
certain anthropologists. Rigged out in cast-off garments of Mr. Jeremy
Bentham and Mr. Gradgrind, this horrible phantom is apparently actuated
by no other motive than that of filthy lucre, which he pursues
relentlessly, on Spencerian principles, along the line of least
resistance. If such a dismal fiction is really regarded by serious
inquirers as having any counterpart in savage society, and not simply
as a useful abstraction, Dr. Malinowski&rsquo;s account of the
<i>Kula</i> in this book should <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e263"
href="#xd26e263" name="xd26e263">xi</a>]</span>help to lay the phantom
by the heels; for he proves that the trade in useful objects, which
forms part of the <i>Kula</i> system, is in the minds of the natives
entirely subordinate in importance to the exchange of other objects,
which serve no utilitarian purpose whatever. In its combination of
commercial enterprise, social organisation, mythical background, and
magical ritual, to say nothing of the wide geographical range of its
operations, this singular institution appears to have no exact parallel
in the existing anthropological record; but its discoverer, Dr.
Malinowski, may very well be right in surmising that it is probably a
type of institution of which analogous, if not precisely similar,
instances will hereafter be brought to light by further research among
savage and barbarous peoples.</p>
<p>Not the least interesting and instructive feature of the
<i>Kula</i>, as it is described for us by Dr. Malinowski, is the
extremely important part which magic is seen to play in the
institution. From his description it appears that in the minds of the
natives the performance of magical rites and the utterance of magical
words are indispensable for the success of the enterprise in all its
phases, from the felling of the trees out of which the canoes are to be
hollowed, down to the moment when, the expedition successfully
accomplished, the argosy with its precious cargo is about to start on
its homeward voyage. And incidentally we learn that magical ceremonies
and spells are deemed no less necessary for the cultivation of gardens
and for success in fishing, the two forms of industrial enterprise
which furnish the islanders with their principal means of support;
hence the garden magician, whose business it is to promote the growth
of the garden produce by his hocus-pocus, is one of the most important
men in the village, ranking next after the chief and the sorcerer. In
short, magic is believed to be an absolutely essential adjunct of every
industrial undertaking, being just as requisite for its success as the
mechanical operations involved in it, such as the caulking, painting
and launching of a canoe, the planting of a garden, and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e273" href="#xd26e273" name=
"xd26e273">xii</a>]</span>setting of a fish-trap. &ldquo;A belief in
magic,&rdquo; says Dr. Malinowski, &ldquo;is one of the main
psychological forces which allow for organisation and systematisation
of economic effort in the Trobriands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This valuable account of magic as a factor of fundamental economic
importance for the welfare and indeed for the very existence of the
community should suffice to dispel the erroneous view that magic, as
opposed to religion, is in its nature essentially maleficent and
anti-social, being always used by an individual for the promotion of
his own selfish ends and the injury of his enemies, quite regardless of
its effect on the common weal. No doubt magic may be so employed, and
has in fact probably been so employed, in every part of the world; in
the Trobriand Islands themselves it is believed to be similarly
practised for nefarious purposes by sorcerers, who inspire the natives
with the deepest dread and the most constant concern. But in itself
magic is neither beneficent nor maleficent; it is simply an imaginary
power of controlling the forces of nature, and this control may be
exercised by the magician for good or evil, for the benefit or injury
of individuals and of the community. In this respect, magic is exactly
on the same footing with the sciences, of which it is the bastard
sister. They, too, in themselves, are neither good nor evil, though
they become the source of one or other according to their application.
It would be absurd, for example, to stigmatise pharmacy as antisocial,
because a knowledge of the properties of drugs is often employed to
destroy men as well as to heal them. It is equally absurd to neglect
the beneficent application of magic and to single out its maleficent
use as the characteristic property by which to define it. The processes
of nature, over which science exercises a real and magic an imaginary
control, are not affected by the moral disposition, the good or bad
intention, of the individual who uses his knowledge to set them in
motion. The action of drugs on the human body is precisely the same
whether they are administered by a physician or by a poisoner.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e277" href="#xd26e277" name=
"xd26e277">xiii</a>]</span>Nature and her handmaid Science are neither
friendly nor hostile to morality; they are simply indifferent to it and
equally ready to do the bidding of the saint and of the sinner,
provided only that he gives them the proper word of command. If the
guns are well loaded and well aimed, the fire of the battery will be
equally destructive, whether the gunners are patriots fighting in
defence of their country or invaders waging a war of unjust aggression.
The fallacy of differentiating a science or an art according to its
application and the moral intention of the agent is obvious enough with
regard to pharmacy and artillery; it is equally real, though to many
people apparently it is less obvious, with regard to magic.</p>
<p>The immense influence wielded by magic over the whole life and
thought of the Trobriand Islanders is perhaps the feature of Dr.
Malinowski&rsquo;s book which makes the most abiding impression on the
mind of the reader. He tells us that &ldquo;magic, the attempt of man
to govern the forces of nature directly by means of a special lore, is
all-pervading and all-important in the Trobriands&rdquo;; it is
&ldquo;interwoven into all the many industrial and communal
activities&rdquo;; &ldquo;all the data which have been so far mustered
disclose the extreme importance of magic in the Kula. But if it were a
<span class="corr" id="xd26e281" title=
"Source: questions">question</span> of treating of any other aspect of
the tribal life of these natives, it would also be found that, whenever
they approach any concern of vital importance, they summon magic to
their aid. It can be said without exaggeration that magic, according to
their ideas, governs human destinies; that it supplies man with the
power of mastering the forces of nature; and that it is his weapon and
armour against the many dangers which crowd in upon him on every
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus in the view of the Trobriand Islanders, magic is a power of
supreme importance either for good or evil; it can make or mar the life
of man; it can sustain and protect the individual and the community, or
it can injure and destroy them. Compared to this universal and
deep-rooted conviction, the belief in the existence of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e287" href="#xd26e287" name=
"xd26e287">xiv</a>]</span>spirits of the dead would seem to exercise
but little influence on the life of these people. Contrary to the
general attitude of savages towards the souls of the departed, they are
reported to be almost completely devoid of any fear of ghosts. They
believe, indeed, that the ghosts return to their villages once a year
to partake of the great annual feast; but &ldquo;in general the spirits
do not influence human beings very much, for better or worse&rdquo;;
&ldquo;there is nothing of the mutual interaction, of the intimate
collaboration between man and spirit which are the essence of religious
cult.&rdquo; This conspicuous predominance of magic over religion, at
least over the worship of the dead, is a very notable feature in the
culture of a people so comparatively high in the scale of savagery as
the Trobriand Islanders. It furnishes a fresh proof of the
extraordinary strength and tenacity of the hold which this world-wide
delusion has had, and still has, upon the human mind.</p>
<p>We shall doubtless learn much as to the relation of magic and
religion among the Trobrianders from the full report of Dr.
Malinowski&rsquo;s researches in the islands. From the patient
observation which he has devoted to a single institution, and from the
wealth of details with which he has illustrated it, we may judge of the
extent and value of the larger work which he has in preparation. It
promises to be one of the completest and most scientific accounts ever
given of a savage people.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">By the Author</p>
<p>Ethnology is in the sadly ludicrous, not to say tragic, position,
that at the very moment when it begins to put its workshop in order, to
forge its proper tools, to start ready for work on its appointed task,
the material of its study melts away with hopeless rapidity. Just now,
when the methods and aims of scientific field ethnology have taken
shape, when men fully trained for the work have begun to travel into
savage countries and study their inhabitants&mdash;these die away under
our very eyes.</p>
<p>The research which has been done on native races by men of academic
training has proved beyond doubt and cavil that scientific, methodic
inquiry can give us results far more abundant and of better quality
than those of even the best amateur&rsquo;s work. Most, though not all,
of the modern scientific accounts have opened up quite new and
unexpected aspects of tribal life. They have given us, in clear
outline, the picture of social institutions often surprisingly vast and
complex; they have brought before us the vision of the native as he is,
in his religious and magical beliefs and practices. They have allowed
us to penetrate into his mind far more deeply than we have ever done
before. From this new material, scientifically hall-marked, students of
comparative Ethnology have already drawn some very important
conclusions on the origin of human customs, beliefs and institutions;
on the history of cultures, and their spread and contact; on the laws
of human behaviour in society, and of the human mind.</p>
<p>The hope of gaining a new vision of savage humanity through the
labours of scientific specialists opens out like a mirage, vanishing
almost as soon as perceived. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e311"
href="#xd26e311" name="xd26e311">xvi</a>]</span>For though at present,
there is still a large number of native communities available for
scientific study, within a generation or two, they or their cultures
will have practically disappeared. The need for energetic work is
urgent, and the time is short. Nor, alas, up to the present, has any
adequate interest been taken by the public in these studies. The number
of workers is small, the encouragement they receive scanty. I feel
therefore no need to justify an ethnological contribution which is the
result of specialised research in the field.</p>
<p>In this volume I give an account of one phase of savage life only,
in describing certain forms of inter-tribal, trading relations among
the natives of New Guinea. This account has been culled, as a
preliminary monograph, from Ethnographic material, covering the whole
extent of the tribal culture of one district. One of the first
conditions of acceptable Ethnographic work certainly is that it should
deal with the totality of all social, cultural and psychological
aspects of the community, for they are so interwoven that not one can
be understood without taking into consideration all the others. The
reader of this monograph will clearly see that, though its main theme
is economic&mdash;for it deals with commercial enterprise, exchange and
trade&mdash;constant reference has to be made to social organisation,
the power of magic, to mythology and folklore, and indeed to all other
aspects as well as the main one.</p>
<p>The geographical area of which the book treats is limited to the
Archipelagoes lying off the eastern end of New Guinea. Even within
this, the main field of research was in one district, that of the
Trobriand Islands. This, however, has been studied minutely. I have
lived in that one archipelago for about two years, in the course of
three expeditions to New Guinea, during which time I naturally acquired
a thorough knowledge of the language. I did my work entirely alone,
living for the greater part of the time right in the villages. I
therefore had constantly the daily life of the natives before my eyes,
while accidental, dramatic occurrences, deaths, quarrels, village
brawls, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e317" href="#xd26e317" name=
"xd26e317">xvii</a>]</span>public and ceremonial events, could not
escape my notice.</p>
<p>In the present state of Ethnography, when so much has still to be
done in paving the way for forthcoming research and in fixing its
scope, each new contribution ought to justify its appearance in several
Points. It ought to show some advance in method; it ought to push
research beyond its previous limits in depth, in width, or in both;
finally, it ought to endeavour to present its results in a manner
exact, but not dry. The specialist interested in method, in reading
this work, will find set out in the Introduction, Divisions <a href=
"#div0.2">II</a>&ndash;<a href="#div0.9">IX</a> and in <a href=
"#ch18">Chapter XVIII</a>, the exposition of my points of view and
efforts in this direction. The reader who is concerned with results,
rather than with the way of obtaining them, will find in Chapters
<a href="#ch4">IV</a> to <a href="#ch21">XXI</a> a consecutive
narrative of the Kula expeditions, and the various associated customs
and beliefs. The student who is interested, not only in the narrative,
but in the ethnographic background for it, and a clear definition of
the institution, will find the first in Chapters <a href="#ch1">I</a>
and <a href="#ch2">II</a>, and the latter in Chapter <a href=
"#ch3">III</a>.</p>
<p>To Mr. Robert Mond I tender my sincerest thanks. It is to his
generous endowment that I owe the possibility of carrying on for
several years the research of which the present volume is a partial
result. To Mr. Atlee Hunt, C.M.G., Secretary of the Home and
Territories Department of the Commonwealth of Australia, I am indebted
for the financial assistance of the Department, and also for much help
given on the spot. In the Trobriands, I was immensely helped in my work
by Mr. B. Hancock, pearl trader, to whom I am grateful not only for
assistance and services, but for many acts of friendship.</p>
<p>Much of the argument in this book has been greatly improved by the
criticism given me by my friend, Mr. Paul Khuner, of Vienna, an expert
in the practical affairs of modern industry and a highly competent
thinker on economic matters. Professor L. T. Hobhouse has kindly read
the proofs and given me valuable advice on several points. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e350" href="#xd26e350" name=
"xd26e350">xviii</a>]</span></p>
<p>Sir James Frazer, by writing his Preface, has enhanced the value of
this volume beyond its merit and it is not only a great honour and
advantage for me to be introduced by him, but also a special pleasure,
for my first love for ethnology is associated with the reading of the
&ldquo;Golden Bough,&rdquo; then in its second edition.</p>
<p>Last, not least, I wish to mention Professor C. G. Seligman, to whom
this book is dedicated. The initiative of my expedition was given by
him and I owe him more than I can express for the encouragement and
scientific counsel which he has so generously given me during the
progress of my work in New Guinea.</p>

<p class="first">It is in the nature of the research, that an
Ethnographer has to rely upon the assistance of others to an extent
much greater than is the case with other scientific workers. I have
therefore to express in this special place my obligations to the many
who have helped me. As said in the Preface, financially I owe most to
Mr. Robert Mond, who made my work possible by bestowing on me the
Robert Mond Travelling Scholarship (University of London) of &pound;250
per annum for five years (for 1914 and for 1917&ndash;1920). I was
substantially helped by a grant of &pound;250 from the Home and
Territories Department of Australia, obtained by the good offices of
Mr. Atlee Hunt, C.M.G. The London School of Economics awarded me the
Constance Hutchinson Scholarship of &pound;100 yearly for two years,
1915&ndash;1916. Professor Seligman, to whom in this, as in other
matters I owe so much, besides helping me in obtaining all the other
grants, gave himself &pound;100 towards the cost of the expedition and
equipped me with a camera, a phonograph, anthropometric instruments and
other paraphernalia of ethnographic work. I went out to Australia with
the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1914, as a
guest, and at the expense, of the Commonwealth Government of
Australia.</p>
<p>It may be interesting for intending field-workers to observe that I
carried out my ethnographic research for six years&mdash;1914 to
1920&mdash;making three expeditions to the field of my work, and
devoting the intervals between expeditions to the working out of my
material and to the study of special literature, on little more than
&pound;250 a year. I defrayed out of this, not only all the expenses of
travel and research, such as fares, wages to native servants, payments
of interpreters, but I was also able to collect a fair amount of
ethnographic specimens, of which part has been presented to the
Melbourne Museum as the Robert Mond Collection. This would not have
been possible for me, had I not received much help from residents in
New Guinea. My friend, Mr. B. Hancock, of Gusaweta, Trobriand Islands,
allowed me to use his house and store as base for my gear and
provisions; he lent me his cutter on various occasions and provided me
with a home, where I could always repair in need or sickness. He helped
me in my photographic work, and gave me a good number of his own
photographic plates, of which several are reproduced in this book
(Plates <a href="#pl11">XI</a>, <a href="#pl37">XXXVII</a>, and
<a href="#pl50">L</a>&ndash;<a href="#pl52">LII</a>).</p>
<p>Other pearl traders and buyers of the Trobriands were also very kind
to me, especially M. and Mme. Raphael Brudo, of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="xd26e390" href="#xd26e390" name=
"xd26e390">xx</a>]</span>Paris, Messrs. C. and G. Auerbach, and the
late Mr. Mick George, all of whom helped me in various ways and
extended to me their kind hospitality.</p>
<p>In my interim studies in Melbourne, I received much help from the
staff of the excellent Public Library of Victoria, for which I have to
thank the Librarian, Mr. E. La Touche Armstrong, my friend Mr. E. Pitt,
Mr. Cooke and others.</p>
<p>Two maps and two plates are reproduced by kind permission of
Professor Seligman from his &ldquo;Melanesians of British New
Guinea.&rdquo; I have to thank the Editor of <i>Man</i> (Captain T. A.
Joyce) for his permission to use here again the plates which were
previously published in that paper.</p>
<p>Mr. William Swan Stallybrass, Senior Managing Director of Messrs.
Geo. Routledge &amp; Sons, Ltd., has spared no trouble in meeting all
my wishes as to scientific details in the publication of this book, for
which I wish to express my sincere thanks.</p>

<p class="first">The native names and words in this book are written
according to the simple rules, recommended by the Royal Geographical
Society and the Royal Anthropological Institute. That is, the vowels
are to be pronounced as in Italian and the consonants as in English.
This spelling suits the sounds of the Melanesian languages of New
Guinea sufficiently well. The apostrophe placed between two vowels
indicates that they should be pronounced separately and not merged into
a diphthong. The accent is almost always on the penultimate, rarely on
the anti-penultimate. All the syllables must be pronounced clearly and
distinctly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e406" href="#xd26e406"

<p class="first">The coastal populations of the South Sea Islands, with
very few exceptions, are, or were before their extinction, expert
navigators and traders. Several of them had evolved excellent types of
large sea-going canoes, and used to embark in them on distant trade
expeditions or raids of war and conquest. The Papuo-Melanesians, who
inhabit the coast and the out-lying islands of New Guinea, are no
exception to this rule. In general they are daring sailors, industrious
manufacturers, and keen traders. The manufacturing centres of important
articles, such as pottery, stone implements, canoes, fine baskets,
valued ornaments, are localised in several places, according to the
skill of the inhabitants, their inherited tribal tradition, and special
facilities offered by the district; thence they are traded over wide
areas, sometimes travelling more than hundreds of miles.</p>
<p>Definite forms of exchange along definite trade routes are to be
found established between the various tribes. A most remarkable form of
intertribal trade is that obtaining between the Motu of Port Moresby
and the tribes of the Papuan Gulf. The Motu sail for hundreds of miles
in heavy, unwieldy canoes, called <i lang="kij">lakatoi</i>, which are
provided with the characteristic crab-claw sails. They bring pottery
and shell ornaments, in olden days, stone blades, to Gulf Papuans, from
whom they obtain in exchange sago and the heavy dug-outs, which are
used afterwards by the Motu for the construction of their <i lang=
"kij">lakatoi</i> canoes.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1839src" href=
"#xd26e1839" name="xd26e1839src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb2" href="#pb2" name="pb2">2</a>]</span></p>
<p>Further East, on the South coast, there lives the industrious,
sea-faring population of the Mailu, who link the East End of New Guinea
with the central coast tribes by means of annual trading
expeditions.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1848src" href="#xd26e1848"
name="xd26e1848src">2</a> Finally, the natives of the islands and
archipelagoes, scattered around the East End, are in constant trading
relations with one another. We possess in Professor Seligman&rsquo;s
book an excellent description of the subject, especially of the nearer
trades routes between the various islands inhabited by the Southern
Massim.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1851src" href="#xd26e1851" name=
"xd26e1851src">3</a> There exists, however, another, a very extensive
and highly complex trading system, embracing with its ramifications,
not only the islands near the East End, but also the Louisiades,
Woodlark Island, the Trobriand Archipelago, and the
d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux group; it penetrates into the mainland of New
Guinea, and exerts an indirect influence over several outlying
districts, such as Rossel Island, and some parts of the Northern and
Southern coast of New Guinea. This trading system, the Kula, is the
subject I am setting out to describe in this volume, and it will be
seen that it is an economic phenomenon of <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e1854" title="Source: consideraable">considerable</span>
theoretical importance. It looms paramount in the tribal life of those
natives who live within its circuit, and its importance is fully
realised by the tribesmen themselves, whose ideas, ambitions, desires
and vanities are very much bound up with the Kula<span class="corr" id=

<p class="first">Before proceeding to the account of the Kula, it will
be well to give a description of the methods used in the collecting of
the ethnographic material. The results of scientific research in any
branch of learning ought to be presented in a manner absolutely candid
and above board. No one would dream of making an experimental
contribution to physical or chemical science, without giving a detailed
account of all the arrangements of the experiments; an exact
description of the apparatus used; of the manner in which the
observations were conducted; of their number; of the length of time
devoted to them, and of the degree of approximation with which each
measurement was made. In less exact sciences, as in biology or geology,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb3" href="#pb3" name=
"pb3">3</a>]</span>this cannot be done as rigorously, but every student
will do his best to bring home to the reader all the conditions in
which the experiment or the observations were made. In Ethnography,
where a candid account of such data is perhaps even more necessary, it
has unfortunately in the past not always been supplied with sufficient
generosity, and many writers do not ply the full searchlight of
methodic sincerity, as they move among their facts and produce them
before us out of complete obscurity.</p>
<p>It would be easy to quote works of high repute, and with a
scientific hall-mark on them, in which wholesale generalisations are
laid down before us, and we are not informed at all by what actual
experiences the writers have reached their conclusion. No special
chapter or paragraph is devoted to describing to us the conditions
under which observations were made and information collected. I
consider that only such ethnographic sources are of unquestionable
scientific value, in which we can clearly draw the line between, on the
one hand, the results of direct observation and of native statements
and interpretations, and on the other, the inferences of the author,
based on his common sense and <span class="corr" id="xd26e1869" title=
"Source: psycholgical">psychological</span> insight.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e1872src" href="#xd26e1872" name="xd26e1872src">4</a> Indeed,
Some such survey, as that contained in the table, given below (<a href=
"#div0.6">Div. VI of this chapter</a>) ought to be forthcoming, so that
at a glance the reader could estimate with precision the degree of the
writer&rsquo;s personal acquaintance with the facts which he describes,
and form an idea under what conditions information had been obtained
from the natives.</p>
<p>Again, in historical science, no one could expect to be seriously
treated if he made any mystery of his sources and spoke of the past as
if he knew it by divination. In Ethnography, the writer is his own
chronicler and the historian at the same time, while his sources are no
doubt easily accessible, but also supremely elusive and complex; they
are not embodied in fixed, material documents, but in the behaviour and
in the memory of living men. In Ethnography, the distance is often
enormous between the brute material of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb4" href="#pb4" name="pb4">4</a>]</span>information&mdash;as it is
presented to the student in his own observations, in native statement,
in the kaleidoscope of tribal life&mdash;and the final authoritative
presentation of the results. The Ethnographer has to traverse this
distance in the laborious years between the moment when he sets foot
upon a native beach, and makes his first attempts to get into touch
with the natives, and the time when he writes down the final version of
his results. A brief outline of an Ethnographer&rsquo;s tribulations,
as lived through by myself, may throw more light on the question, than
any long abstract discussion could do.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Imagine yourself suddenly set down surrounded by all
your gear, alone on a tropical beach close to a native village, while
the launch or dinghy which has brought you sails away out of sight.
Since you take up your abode in the compound of some neighbouring white
man, trader or missionary, you have nothing to do, but to start at once
on your ethnographic work. Imagine further that you are a beginner,
without previous experience, with nothing to guide you and no one to
help you. For the white man is temporarily absent, or else unable or
unwilling to waste any of his time on you. This exactly describes my
first initiation into field work on the south coast of New Guinea. I
well remember the long visits I paid to the villages during the first
weeks; the feeling of hopelessness and despair after many obstinate but
futile attempts had entirely failed to bring me into real touch with
the natives, or supply me with any material. I had periods of
despondency, when I buried myself in the reading of novels, as a man
might take to drink in a fit of tropical depression and boredom.</p>
<p>Imagine yourself then, making your first entry into the village,
alone or in company with your white cicerone. Some natives flock round
you, especially if they smell tobacco. Others, the more dignified and
elderly, remain seated where they are. Your white companion has his
routine way of treating the natives, and he neither understands, nor is
very much concerned with the manner in which you, as an ethnographer,
will have to approach them. The first visit leaves you with a hopeful
feeling that when you return alone, things will be easier. Such was my
hope at least. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb5" href="#pb5" name=
"pb5">5</a>]</span></p>
<p>I came back duly, and soon gathered an audience around me. A few
compliments in pidgin-English on both sides, some tobacco changing
hands, induced an atmosphere of mutual amiability. I tried then to
proceed to business. First, to begin with subjects which might arouse
no suspicion, I started to &ldquo;do&rdquo; technology. A few natives
were engaged in manufacturing some object or other. It was easy to look
at it and obtain the names of the tools, and even some technical
expressions about the proceedings, but there the matter ended. It must
be borne in mind that pidgin-English is a very imperfect instrument for
expressing one&rsquo;s ideas, and that before one gets a good training
in framing questions and understanding answers one has the
uncomfortable feeling that free communication in it with the natives
will never be attained; and I was quite unable to enter into any more
detailed or explicit conversation with them at first. I knew well that
the best remedy for this was to collect concrete data, and accordingly
I took a village census, wrote down genealogies, drew up plans and
collected the terms of kinship. But all this remained dead material,
which led no further into the understanding of real native mentality or
behaviour, since I could neither procure a good native interpretation
of any of these items, nor get what could be called the hang of tribal
life. As to obtaining their ideas about religion, and magic, their
beliefs in sorcery and spirits, nothing was forthcoming except a few
superficial items of folk-lore, mangled by being forced into
<span class="corr" id="xd26e1892" title=
"Source: pidgin English">pidgin-English</span>.</p>
<p>Information which I received from some white residents in the
district, valuable as it was in itself, was more discouraging than
anything else with regard to my own work. Here were men who had lived
for years in the place with constant opportunities of observing the
natives and communicating with them, and who yet hardly knew one thing
about them really well. How could I therefore in a few months or a
year, hope to overtake and go beyond them? Moreover, the manner in
which my white informants spoke about the natives and put their views
was, naturally, that of untrained minds, unaccustomed to formulate
their thoughts with any degree of consistency and precision. And they
were for the most part, naturally enough, full of the biassed and
pre-judged opinions inevitable in the average practical man, whether
administrator, missionary, or trader; yet so strongly repulsive to a
mind striving after the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6"
name="pb6">6</a>]</span>objective, scientific view of things. The habit
of treating with a self-satisfied frivolity what is really serious to
the ethnographer; the cheap rating of what to him is a scientific
treasure, that is to say, the native&rsquo;s cultural and mental
peculiarities and independence&mdash;these features, so well known in
the inferior amateur&rsquo;s writing, I found in the tone of the
majority of white residents.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e1899src" href=

<p>Indeed, in my first piece of Ethnographic research on the South
coast, it was not until I was alone in the district that I began to
make some headway; and, at any rate, I found out where lay the secret
of effective field-work. What is then this ethnographer&rsquo;s magic,
by which he is able to evoke the real spirit of the natives, the true
picture of tribal life? As usual, success can only be obtained by a
patient and systematic application of a number of rules of common sense
and well-known scientific principles, and not by the discovery of any
marvellous short-cut leading to the desired results without effort or
trouble. The principles of method can be grouped under three main
headings; first of all, naturally, the student must possess real
scientific aims, and know the values and criteria of modern
ethnography. Secondly, he ought to put himself in good conditions of
work, that is, in the main, to live without other white men, right
among the natives. Finally, he has to apply a number of special methods
of collecting, manipulating and fixing his evidence. A few words must
be said about these three foundation stones of fieldwork, beginning
with the second as the most elementary.</p>

<p class="first"><i>Proper conditions for ethnographic work</i>. These,
as said, consist mainly in cutting oneself off from the company of
other white men, and remaining in as close contact with the natives as
possible, which really can only be achieved by camping right in their
villages (see Plates <a href="#pl01">I</a> and <a href="#pl02">II</a>).
It is very nice to have a base in a white man&rsquo;s compound for the
stores, and to know there is a refuge there in times of sickness and
surfeit of native. But it must be far enough away not to become a
permanent milieu in which you live and from which you emerge at fixed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>hours only to &ldquo;do the village.&rdquo; It
should not even be near enough to fly to at any moment for recreation.
For the native is not the natural companion for a white man, and after
you have been working with him for several hours, seeing how he does
his gardens, or letting him tell you items of folk-lore, or discussing
his customs, you will naturally hanker after the company of your own
kind. But if you are alone in a village beyond reach of this, you go
for a solitary walk for an hour or so, return again and then quite
naturally seek out the natives&rsquo; society, this time as a relief
from loneliness, just as you would any other companionship. And by
means of this natural intercourse, you learn to know him, and you
become familiar with his customs and beliefs far better than when he is
a paid, and often bored, informant.</p>
<p>There is all the difference between a sporadic plunging into the
company of natives, and being really in contact with them. What does
this latter mean? On the Ethnographer&rsquo;s side, it means that his
life in the village, which at first is a strange, sometimes unpleasant,
sometimes intensely interesting adventure, soon adopts quite a natural
course very much in harmony with his surroundings.</p>
<p>Soon after I had established myself in Omarakana (Trobriand
Islands), I began to take part, in a way, in the village life, to look
forward to the important or festive events, to take personal interest
in the gossip and the developments of the small village occurrences; to
wake up every morning to a day, presenting itself to me more or less as
it does to the native. I would get out from under my mosquito net, to
find around me the village life beginning to stir, or the people well
advanced in their working day according to the hour and also to the
season, for they get up and begin their labours early or late, as work
presses. As I went on my morning walk through the village, I could see
intimate details of family life, of toilet, cooking, taking of meals; I
could see the arrangements for the day&rsquo;s work, people starting on
their errands, or groups of men and women busy at some manufacturing
tasks (see <a href="#pl03">Plate III</a>). Quarrels, jokes, family
scenes, events usually trivial, sometimes dramatic but always
significant, formed the atmosphere of my daily life, as well as of
theirs. It must be remembered that as the natives saw me constantly
every day, they ceased to be interested or alarmed, or made
self-conscious by my <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8"
name="pb8">8</a>]</span>presence, and I ceased to be a disturbing
element in the tribal life which I was to study, altering it by my very
approach, as always happens with a new-comer to every savage community.
In fact, as they knew that I would thrust my nose into everything, even
where a well-mannered native would not dream of intruding, they
finished by regarding me as part and parcel of their life, a necessary
evil or nuisance, mitigated by donations of tobacco.</p>
<p>Later on in the day, whatever happened was within easy reach, and
there was no possibility of its escaping my notice. Alarms about the
sorcerer&rsquo;s approach in the evening, one or two big, really
important quarrels and rifts within the community, cases of illness,
attempted cures and deaths, magical rites which had to be performed,
all these I had not to pursue, fearful of missing them, but they took
place under my very eyes, at my own doorstep, so to speak (see <a href=
"#pl04">Plate IV</a>). And it must be emphasised whenever anything
dramatic or important occurs it is essential to investigate it at the
very moment of happening, because the natives cannot but talk about it,
are too excited to be reticent, and too interested to be mentally lazy
in supplying details. Also, over and over again, I committed breaches
of etiquette, which the natives, familiar enough with me, were not slow
in pointing out. I had to learn how to behave, and to a certain extent,
I acquired &ldquo;the feeling&rdquo; for native good and bad manners.
With this, and with the capacity of enjoying their company and sharing
some of their games and amusements, I began to feel that I was indeed
in touch with the natives, and this is certainly the preliminary
condition of being able to carry on successful field work.</p>

<p class="first">But the Ethnographer has not only to spread his nets
in the right place, and wait for what will fall into them. He must be
an active huntsman, and drive his quarry into them and follow it up to
its most inaccessible lairs. And that leads us to the more active
methods of pursuing ethnographic evidence. It has been mentioned at the
end of <a href="#div0.3">Division III</a> that the Ethnographer has to
be inspired by the knowledge of the most modern results of scientific
study, by its principles and aims. I shall not enlarge upon this
subject, except by way of one remark, to avoid the possibility of
misunderstanding. Good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9"
name="pb9">9</a>]</span>training in theory, and acquaintance with its
latest results, is not identical with being burdened with
&ldquo;preconceived ideas.&rdquo; If a man sets out on an expedition,
determined to prove certain hypotheses, if he is incapable of changing
his views constantly and casting them off ungrudgingly under the
pressure of evidence, needless to say his work will be worthless. But
the more problems he brings with him into the field, the more he is in
the habit of moulding his theories according to facts, and of seeing
facts in their bearing upon theory, the better he is equipped for the
work. Preconceived ideas are pernicious in any scientific work, but
foreshadowed problems are the main endowment of a scientific thinker,
and these problems are first revealed to the observer by his
theoretical studies.</p>
<p>In Ethnology the early efforts of Bastian, Tylor, Morgan, the German
V&ouml;lkerpsychologen have remoulded the older crude information of
travellers, missionaries, etc., and have shown us the importance of
applying deeper conceptions and discarding crude and misleading
ones.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2008src" href="#xd26e2008" name=
"xd26e2008src">6</a></p>
<p>The concept of animism superseded that of &ldquo;fetichism&rdquo; or
&ldquo;devil-worship,&rdquo; both meaningless terms. The understanding
of the classificatory systems of relationship paved the way for the
brilliant, modern researches on native sociology in the field-work of
the Cambridge school. The psychological analysis of the German thinkers
has brought forth an abundant crop of most valuable information in the
results obtained by the recent German expeditions to Africa, South
America and the Pacific, while the theoretical works of Frazer,
Durkheim and others have already, and will no doubt still for a long
time inspire field workers and lead them to new results. The field
worker relies entirely upon inspiration from theory. Of course he may
be also a theoretical thinker and worker, and there he can draw on
himself for stimulus. But the two functions are separate, and in actual
research they have to be separated both in time and conditions of
work.</p>
<p>As always happens when scientific interest turns towards and begins
to labour on a field so far only prospected by the curiosity of
amateurs, Ethnology has introduced law and order into what seemed
chaotic and freakish. It has transformed for us the sensational, wild
and unaccountable world of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href=
"#pb10" name="pb10">10</a>]</span>&ldquo;savages&rdquo; into a number
of well ordered communities, governed by law, behaving and thinking
according to consistent principles. The word &ldquo;savage,&rdquo;
whatever association it might have had originally, connotes ideas of
boundless liberty, of irregularity, of something extremely and
extraordinarily quaint. In popular thinking, we imagine that the
natives live on the bosom of Nature, more or less as they can and like,
the prey of irregular, phantasmagoric beliefs and apprehensions. Modern
science, on the contrary, shows that their social institutions have a
very definite organisation, that they are governed by authority, law
and order in their public and personal relations, while the latter are,
besides, under the control of extremely complex ties of kinship and
clanship. Indeed, we see them entangled in a mesh of duties, functions
and privileges which correspond to an elaborate tribal, communal and
kinship organisation (see <a href="#pl04">Plate IV</a>). Their beliefs
and practices do not by any means lack consistency of a certain type,
and their knowledge of the outer world is sufficient to guide them in
many of their strenuous enterprises and activities. Their artistic
productions again lack neither meaning nor beauty.</p>
<p>It is a very far cry from the famous answer given long ago by a
representative authority who, asked, what are the manners and customs
of the natives, answered, &ldquo;Customs none, manners beastly,&rdquo;
to the position of the modern Ethnographer! This latter, with his
tables of kinship terms, genealogies, maps, plans and diagrams, proves
an extensive and big organisation, shows the constitution of the tribe,
of the clan, of the family; and he gives us a picture of the natives
subjected to a strict code of behaviour and good manners, to which in
comparison the life at the Court of Versailles or Escurial was free and
easy.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2022src" href="#xd26e2022" name=
"xd26e2022src">7</a></p>
<p>Thus the first and basic ideal of ethnographic field-work is to give
a clear and firm outline of the social constitution, and disentangle
the laws and regularities of all cultural phenomena <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name="pb11">11</a>]</span>from the
irrelevances. The firm skeleton of the tribal life has to be first
ascertained. This ideal imposes in the first place the fundamental
obligation of giving a complete survey of the phenomena, and not of
picking out the sensational, the singular, still less the funny and
quaint. The time when we could tolerate accounts presenting us the
native as a distorted, childish caricature of a human being are gone.
This picture is false, and like many other falsehoods, it has been
killed by Science. The field Ethnographer has seriously and soberly to
cover the full extent of the phenomena in each aspect of tribal culture
studied, making no difference between What is commonplace, or drab, or
ordinary, and what strikes him as astonishing and out-of-the-way. At
the same time, the whole area of tribal culture <i>in all its
aspects</i> has to be gone over in research. The consistency, the law
and order which obtain within each aspect make also for joining them
into one coherent whole.</p>
<p>An Ethnographer who sets out to study only religion, or only
technology, or only social organisation cuts out an artificial field
for inquiry, and he will be seriously handicapped in his work.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Having settled this very general rule, let us descend
to more detailed consideration of method. The Ethnographer has in the
field, according to what has just been said, the duty before him of
drawing up all the rules and regularities of tribal life; all that is
permanent and fixed; of giving an anatomy of their culture, of
depicting the constitution of their society. But these things, though
crystallised and set, are nowhere <i>formulated</i>. There is no
written or explicitly expressed code of laws, and their whole tribal
tradition, the whole structure of their society, are embodied in the
most elusive of all materials; the human being. But not even in human
mind or memory are these laws to be found definitely formulated. The
natives obey the forces and commands of the tribal code, but they do
not comprehend them; exactly as they obey their instincts and their
impulses, but could not lay down a single law of psychology. The
regularities in native institutions are an automatic result of the
interaction of the mental forces of tradition, and of the material
conditions of environment. Exactly as a humble member of any modern
institution, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>whether it be the state, or the church, or the
army, is <i>of</i> it and <i>in</i> it, but has no vision of the
resulting integral action of the whole, still less could furnish any
account of its organisation, so it would be futile to attempt
questioning a native in abstract, sociological terms. The difference is
that, in our society, every institution has its intelligent members,
its historians, and its archives and documents, whereas in a native
society there are none of these. After this is realised an expedient
has to be found to overcome this difficulty. This expedient for an
Ethnographer consists in collecting concrete data of evidence, and
drawing the general inferences for himself. This seems obvious on the
face of it, but was not found out or at least practised in Ethnography
till field work was taken up by men of science. Moreover, in giving it
practical effect, it is neither easy to devise the concrete
applications of this method, nor to carry them out systematically and
consistently.</p>
<p>Though we cannot ask a native about abstract, general rules, we can
always enquire how a given case would be treated. Thus for instance, in
asking how they would treat crime, or punish it, it would be vain to
put to a native a sweeping question such as, &ldquo;How do you treat
and punish a criminal?&rdquo; for even words could not be found to
express it in native, or in pidgin. But an imaginary case, or still
better, a real occurrence, will stimulate a native to express his
opinion and to supply plentiful information. A real case indeed will
start the natives on a wave of discussion, evoke expressions of
indignation, show them taking sides&mdash;all of which talk will
probably contain a wealth of definite views, of moral censures, as well
as reveal the social mechanism set in motion by the crime committed.
From there, it will be easy to lead them on to speak of other similar
cases, to remember other actual occurrences or to discuss them in all
their implications and aspects. From this material, which ought to
cover the widest possible range of facts, the inference is obtained by
simple induction. The <i>scientific</i> treatment differs from that of
good common sense, first in that a student will extend the completeness
and minuteness of survey much further and in a pedantically systematic
and methodical manner; and secondly, in that the scientifically trained
mind, will push the inquiry along really relevant lines, and towards
aims possessing real importance. Indeed, the object of scientific
training is to provide the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href=
"#pb13" name="pb13">13</a>]</span>empirical investigator with a
<i>mental chart</i>, in accordance with which he can take his bearings
and lay his course.</p>
<p>To return to our example, a number of definite cases discussed will
reveal to the Ethnographer the social machinery for punishment. This is
one part, one aspect of tribal authority. Imagine further that by a
similar method of inference from definite data, he arrives at
understanding leadership in war, in economic enterprise, in tribal
festivities&mdash;there he has at once all the data necessary to answer
the questions about tribal government and social authority. In actual
field work, the comparison of such data, the attempt to piece them
together, will often reveal rifts and gaps in the information which
lead on to further investigations.</p>
<p>From my own experience, I can say that, very often, a problem seemed
settled, everything fixed and clear, till I began to write down a short
preliminary sketch of my results. And only then, did I see the enormous
deficiencies, which would show me where lay new problems, and lead me
on to new work. In fact, I spent a few months between my first and
second expeditions, and over a year between that and the subsequent
one, in going over all my material, and making parts of it almost ready
for publication each time, though each time I knew I would have to
re-write it. Such cross-fertilisation of constructive work and
observation, I found most valuable, and I do not think I could have
made real headway without it. I give this bit of my own history merely
to show that what has been said so far is not only an empty programme,
but the result of personal experience. In this volume, the description
is given of a big institution connected with ever so many associated
activities, and presenting many aspects. To anyone who reflects on the
subject, it will be clear that the information about a phenomenon of
such high complexity and of so many ramifications, could not be
obtained with any degree of exactitude and completeness, without a
constant interplay of constructive attempts and empirical checking. In
fact, I have written up an outline of the Kula institution at least
half a dozen times while in the field and in the intervals between my
expeditions. Each time, new problems and difficulties presented
themselves.</p>
<p>The collecting of concrete data over a wide range of facts is thus
one of the main points of field method. The obligation <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>is not
to enumerate a few examples only, but to exhaust as far as possible all
the cases within reach; and, on this search for cases, the investigator
will score most whose mental chart is clearest. But, whenever the
material of the search allows it, this mental chart ought to be
transformed into a real one; it ought to materialise into a diagram, a
plan, an exhaustive, synoptic table of cases. Long since, in all
tolerably good modern books on natives, we expect to find a full list
or table of kinship terms, which includes all the data relative to it,
and does not just pick out a few strange and anomalous relationships or
expressions. In the investigation of kinship, the following up of one
relation after another in concrete cases leads naturally to the
construction of genealogical tables. Practised already by the best
early writers, such as Munzinger, and, if I remember rightly, Kubary,
this method has been developed to its fullest extent in the works of
Dr. Rivers. Again, studying the concrete data of economic transactions,
in order to trace the history of a valuable object, and to gauge the
nature of its circulation, the principle of completeness and
thoroughness would lead to construct tables of transactions, such as we
find in the work of Professor Seligman.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2068src" href="#xd26e2068" name="xd26e2068src">8</a> It is in
following Professor Seligman&rsquo;s example in this matter that I was
able to settle certain of the more difficult and detailed rules of the
Kula. The method of reducing information, if possible, into charts or
synoptic tables ought to be extended to the study of practically all
aspects of native life. All types of economic transactions may be
studied by following up connected, actual cases, and putting them into
a synoptic chart; again, a table ought to be drawn up of all the gifts
and presents customary in a given society, a table including the
sociological, ceremonial, and economic definition of every item. Also,
systems of magic, connected series of ceremonies, types of legal acts,
all could be charted, allowing each entry to be synoptically defined
under a number of headings. Besides this, of course, the genealogical
census of every community, studied more in detail, extensive maps,
plans and diagrams, illustrating ownership in garden land, hunting and
fishing privileges, etc., serve as the more fundamental documents of
ethnographic research.</p>
<p>A genealogy is nothing else but a synoptic chart of a number
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name=
"pb15">15</a>]</span>of connected relations of kinship. Its value as an
instrument of research consists in that it allows the investigator to
put questions which he formulates to himself <i lang="la">in
abstracto</i>, but can put concretely to the native informant. As a
document, its value consists in that it gives a number of authenticated
data, presented in their natural grouping. A synoptic chart of magic
fulfils the same function. As an instrument of research, I have used it
in order to ascertain, for instance, the ideas about the nature of
magical power. With a chart before me, I could easily and conveniently
go over one item after the other, and note down the relevant practices
and beliefs contained in each of them. The answer to my abstract
problem could then be obtained by drawing a general inference from all
the cases, and the procedure is illustrated in Chapters <a href=
"#ch17">XVII</a> and <a href="#ch18">XVIII</a>.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2084src" href="#xd26e2084" name="xd26e2084src">9</a> I cannot
enter further into the discussion of this question, which would need
further distinctions, such as between a chart of concrete, actual data,
such as is a genealogy, and a chart summarising the outlines of a
custom or belief, as a chart of a magical system would be.</p>
<p>Returning once more to the question of methodological candour,
discussed previously in <a href="#div0.2">Division II</a> I wish to
point out here, that the procedure of concrete and tabularised
presentation of data ought to be applied first to the
Ethnographer&rsquo;s own credentials. That is, an Ethnographer, who
wishes to be trusted, must show clearly and concisely, in a tabularised
form, which are his own direct observations, and which the indirect
information that form the bases of his account. The Table on the next
page will serve as an example of this procedure and help the reader of
this book to form an idea of the trustworthiness of any statement he is
specially anxious to check. With the help of this Table and the many
references scattered throughout the text, as to how, under what
circumstances, and with what degree of accuracy I arrived at a given
item of knowledge, there will, I hope remain no obscurity whatever as
to the sources of the book. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb016" href=

<p>To summarise the first, cardinal point of method, I may say each
phenomenon ought to be studied through the broadest range possible of
its concrete manifestations; each studied by an exhaustive survey of
detailed examples. If possible, the results ought to be embodied into
some sort of synoptic chart, both to be used as an instrument of study,
and to be presented as an ethnological document. With the help of such
documents and such study of actualities the clear outline of the
framework of the natives&rsquo; culture in the widest sense of the
word, and the constitution of their society, can be presented. This
method could be called <i>the method of statistic documentation by
concrete evidence</i>.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Needless to add, in this respect, the scientific
field-work is far above even the best amateur productions. There is,
however, one point in which the latter often excel. This is, in the
presentation of intimate touches of native life, in bringing home to us
these aspects of it with which one is made familiar only through being
in close contact with the natives, one way or the other, for a long
period of time. In certain results of scientific work&mdash;especially
that which has been called &ldquo;survey work&rdquo;&mdash;we are given
an excellent skeleton, so to speak, of the tribal constitution, but it
lacks flesh and blood. We learn much about the framework of their
society, but within it, we cannot perceive or imagine the realities of
human life, the even flow of everyday events, the occasional ripples of
excitement over a feast, or ceremony, or some singular occurrence. In
working out the rules and regularities of native custom, and in
obtaining a precise formula for them from the collection of data and
native statements, we find that this very precision is foreign to real
life, which never adheres rigidly to any rules. It must be supplemented
by the observation of the manner in which a given custom is carried
out, of the behaviour of the natives in obeying the rules so exactly
formulated by the ethnographer, of the very exceptions which in
sociological phenomena almost always occur.</p>
<p>If all the conclusions are solely based on the statements of
informants, or deduced from objective documents, it is of course
impossible to supplement them in actually observed data of real
behaviour. And that is the reason why certain works of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name="pb18">18</a>]</span>amateur
residents of long standing, such as educated traders and planters,
medical men and officials, and last, not least, of the few intelligent
and unbiassed missionaries to whom Ethnography owes so much, this is
the reason why these works surpass in plasticity and in vividness most
of the purely scientific accounts. But if the specialised field-worker
can adopt the conditions of living described above, he is in a far
better position to be really in touch with the natives than any other
white resident. For none of them lives right in a native village,
except for very short periods, and everyone has his own business, which
takes up a considerable part of his time. Moreover, if, like a trader
or a missionary or an official he enters into active relations with the
native, if he has to transform or influence or make use of him, this
makes a real, unbiassed, impartial observation impossible, and
precludes all-round sincerity, at least in the case of the missionaries
and officials.</p>
<p>Living in the village with no other business but to follow native
life, one sees the customs, ceremonies and transactions over and over
again, one has examples of their beliefs as they are actually lived
through, and the full body and blood of actual native life fills out
soon the skeleton of abstract constructions. That is the reason why,
working under such conditions as previously described, the Ethnographer
is enabled to add something essential to the bare outline of tribal
constitution, and to supplement it by all the details of behaviour,
setting and small incident. He is able in each case to state whether an
act is public or private; how a public assembly behaves, and what it
looks like; he can judge whether an event is ordinary or an exciting
and singular one; whether natives bring to it a great deal of sincere
and earnest spirit, or perform it in fun; whether they do it in a
perfunctory manner, or with zeal and deliberation.</p>
<p>In other words, there is a series of phenomena of great importance
which cannot possibly be recorded by questioning or computing
documents, but have to be observed in their full actuality. Let us call
them the <i><span class="corr" id="xd26e2220" title=
"Source: inponderabilia">imponderabilia</span> of actual life</i>. Here
belong such things as the routine of a man&rsquo;s working day, the
details of his care of the body, of the manner of taking food and
preparing it; the tone of conversational and social life around the
village fires, the existence of strong friendships or hostilities, and
of passing sympathies and dislikes between <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb19" href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>people;
the subtle yet unmistakable manner in which personal vanities and
ambitions are reflected in the behaviour of the individual and in the
emotional reactions of those who surround him. All these facts can and
ought to be scientifically <span class="corr" id="xd26e2226" title=
"Source: formalated">formulated</span> and recorded, but it is
necessary that this be done, not by a superficial registration of
details, as is usually done by untrained observers, but with an effort
at penetrating the mental attitude expressed in them. And that is the
reason why the work of scientifically trained observers, once seriously
applied to the study of this aspect, will, I believe, yield results of
surpassing value. So far, it has been done only by amateurs, and
therefore done, on the whole, indifferently.</p>
<p>Indeed, if we remember that these imponderable yet all important
facts of actual life are part of the real substance of the social
fabric, that in them are spun the innumerable threads which keep
together the family, the clan, the village community, the
tribe&mdash;their significance becomes clear. The more crystallised
bonds of social grouping, such as the definite ritual, the economic and
legal duties, the obligations, the ceremonial gifts and formal marks of
regard, though equally important for the student, are certainly felt
less strongly by the individual who has to fulfil them. Applying this
to ourselves, we all know that &ldquo;family life&rdquo; means for us,
first and foremost, the atmosphere of home, all the innumerable small
acts and attentions in which are expressed the affection, the mutual
interest, the little preferences, and the little antipathies which
constitute intimacy. That we may inherit from this person, that we
shall have to walk after the hearse of the other, though sociologically
these facts belong to the definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo; and
&ldquo;family life,&rdquo; in personal perspective of what family truly
is to us, they normally stand very much in the background.</p>
<p>Exactly the same applies to a native community, and if the
Ethnographer wants to bring their real life home to his readers, he
must on no account neglect this. Neither aspect, the intimate, as
little as the legal, ought to be glossed over. Yet as a rule in
ethnographic accounts we have not both but either the one or the
other&mdash;and, so far, the intimate one has hardly ever been properly
treated. In all social relations besides the family ties, even those
between mere tribesmen and, beyond that, between hostile or friendly
members of different tribes, meeting on any sort of social business,
there is this intimate <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20"
name="pb20">20</a>]</span>side, expressed by the typical details of
intercourse, the tone of their behaviour in the presence of one
another. This side is different from the definite, crystalised legal
frame of the relationship, and it has to be studied and stated in its
own right.</p>
<p>In the same way, in studying the conspicuous acts of tribal life,
such as ceremonies, rites, festivities, etc., the details and tone of
behaviour ought to be given, besides the bare outline of events. The
importance of this may be exemplified by one instance. Much has been
said and written about survival. Yet the survival character of an act
is expressed in nothing as well as in the concomitant behaviour, in the
way in which it is carried out. Take any example from our own culture,
whether it be the pomp and pageantry of a state ceremony, or a
picturesque custom kept up by street urchins, its &ldquo;outline&rdquo;
will not tell you whether the rite flourishes still with full vigour in
the hearts of those who perform it or assist at the performance or
whether they regard it as almost a dead thing, kept alive for
tradition&rsquo;s sake. But observe and fix the data of their
behaviour, and at once the degree of vitality of the act will become
clear. There is no doubt, from all points of sociological, or
psychological analysis, and in any question of theory, the manner and
type of behaviour observed in the performance of an act is of the
highest importance. Indeed behaviour is a fact, a relevant fact, and
one that can be recorded. And foolish indeed and short-sighted would be
the man of science who would pass by a whole class of phenomena, ready
to be garnered, and leave them to waste, even though he did not see at
the moment to what theoretical use they might be put!</p>
<p>As to the actual method of observing and recording in field-work
these <i>imponderabilia of actual life and of typical behaviour</i>,
there is no doubt that the personal equation of the observer comes in
here more prominently, than in the collection of crystalised,
ethnographic data. But here also the main endeavour must be to let
facts speak for themselves. If in making a daily round of the village,
certain small incidents, characteristic forms of taking food, of
conversing, of doing work (see for instance <a href="#pl03">Plate
III</a>) are found <span class="corr" id="xd26e2245" title=
"Source: occuring">occurring</span> over and over again, they should be
noted down at once. It is also important that this work of collecting
and fixing impressions should begin early in the course of working out
a district. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name=
"pb21">21</a>]</span>Because certain subtle peculiarities, which make
an impression as long as they are novel, cease to be noticed as soon as
they become familiar. Others again can only be perceived with a better
knowledge of the local conditions. An ethnographic diary, carried on
systematically throughout the course of one&rsquo;s work in a district
would be the ideal instrument for this sort of study. And if, side by
side with the normal and typical, the ethnographer carefully notes the
slight, or the more pronounced deviations from it, he will be able to
indicate the two extremes within which the normal moves.</p>
<p>In observing ceremonies or other tribal events, such, for instance
as the scene depicted in <a href="#pl04">Plate IV</a>, it is necessary,
not only to note down those occurrences and details which are
prescribed by tradition and custom to be the essential course of the
act, but also the Ethnographer ought to record carefully and precisely,
one after the other, the actions of the actors and of the spectators.
Forgetting for a moment that he knows and understands the structure of
this ceremony, the main dogmatic ideas underlying it, he might try to
find himself only in the midst of an assembly of human-beings, who
behave seriously or jocularly, with earnest concentration or with bored
frivolity, who are either in the same mood as he finds them every day,
or else are screwed up to a high pitch of excitement, and so on and so
on. With his attention constantly directed to this aspect of tribal
life, with the constant endeavour to fix it, to express it in terms of
actual fact, a good deal of reliable and expressive material finds its
way into his notes. He will be able to &ldquo;set&rdquo; the act into
its proper place in tribal life, that is to show whether it is
exceptional or commonplace, one in which the natives behave ordinarily,
or one in which their whole behaviour is transformed. And he will also
be able to bring all this home to his readers in a clear, convincing
manner.</p>
<p>Again, in this type of work, it is good for the Ethnographer
sometimes to put aside camera, note book and pencil, and to join in
himself in what is going on. He can take part in the natives&rsquo;
games, he can follow them on their visits and walks, sit down and
listen and share in their conversations. I am not certain if this is
equally easy for everyone&mdash;perhaps the Slavonic nature is more
plastic and more naturally savage than that of Western
Europeans&mdash;but though the degree of success varies, the attempt is
possible for everyone. Out of such <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22"
href="#pb22" name="pb22">22</a>]</span>plunges into the life of the
natives&mdash;and I made them frequently not only for study&rsquo;s
sake but because everyone needs human company&mdash;I have carried away
a distinct feeling that their behaviour, their manner of being, in all
sorts of tribal transactions, became more transparent and easily
understandable than it had been before. All these methodological
remarks, the reader will find again illustrated in the following
chapters.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Finally, let us pass to the third and last aim of
scientific field-work, to the last type of phenomenon which ought to be
recorded in order to give a full and adequate picture of native
culture. Besides the firm outline of tribal constitution and
crystallised cultural items which form the skeleton, besides the data
of daily life and ordinary behaviour, which are, so to speak, its flesh
and blood, there is still to be recorded the spirit&mdash;the
natives&rsquo; views and opinions and utterances. For, in every act of
tribal life, there is, first, the routine prescribed by custom and
tradition, then there is the manner in which it is carried out, and
lastly there is the commentary to it, contained in the natives&rsquo;
mind. A man who submits to various customary obligations, who follows a
traditional course of action, does it impelled by certain motives, to
the accompaniment of certain feelings, guided by certain ideas. These
ideas, feelings, and impulses are moulded and conditioned by the
culture in which we find them, and are therefore an ethnic peculiarity
of the given society. An attempt must be made therefore, to study and
record them.</p>
<p>But is this possible? Are these subjective states not too elusive
and shapeless? And, even granted that people usually do feel or think
or experience certain psychological states in association with the
performance of customary acts, the majority of them surely are not able
to formulate these states, to put them into words. This latter point
must certainly be granted, and it is perhaps the real Gordian knot in
the study of the facts of social psychology. Without trying to cut or
untie this knot, that is to solve the problem theoretically, or to
enter further into the field of general methodology, I shall make
directly for the question of practical means to overcome some of the
difficulties involved. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23"
name="pb23">23</a>]</span></p>
<p>First of all, it has to be laid down that we have to study here
stereotyped manners of thinking and feeling. As sociologists, we are
not interested in what A or B may feel <i>qua</i> individuals, in the
accidental course of their own personal experiences&mdash;we are
interested only in what they feel and think <i>qua</i> members of a
given community. Now in this capacity, their mental states receive a
certain stamp, become stereotyped by the institutions in which they
live, by the influence of tradition and folk-lore, by the very vehicle
of thought, that is by language. The social and cultural environment in
which they move forces them to think and feel in a definite manner.
Thus, a man who lives in a polyandrous community cannot experience the
same feelings of jealousy, as a strict monogynist, though he might have
the elements of them. A man who lives within the sphere of the Kula
cannot become permanently and sentimentally attached to certain of his
possessions, in spite of the fact that he values them most of all.
These examples are crude, but better ones will be found in the text of
this book.</p>
<p>So, the third commandment of field-work runs: Find out the typical
ways of thinking and feeling, corresponding to the institutions and
culture of a given community, and formulate the results in the most
convincing manner. What will be the method of procedure? The best
ethnographical writers&mdash;here again the Cambridge school with
Haddon, Rivers, and Seligman rank first among English
Ethnographers&mdash;have always tried to quote <i>verbatim</i>
statements of crucial importance. They also adduce terms of native
classification; sociological, psychological and industrial <i lang=
"la">termini technici</i>, and have rendered the verbal contour of
native thought as precisely as possible. One step further in this line
can be made by the Ethnographer, who acquires a knowledge of the native
language and can use it as an instrument of inquiry. In working in the
Kiriwinian language, I found still some difficulty in writing down the
statement directly in translation which at first I used to do in the
act of taking notes. The translation often robbed the text of all its
significant characteristics&mdash;rubbed off all its points&mdash;so
that gradually I was led to note down certain important phrases just as
they were spoken, in the native tongue. As my knowledge of the language
progressed, I put down more and more in Kiriwinian, till at last I
found myself writing exclusively in that language, rapidly taking
notes, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24" href="#pb24" name=
"pb24">24</a>]</span>word for word, of each statement. No sooner had I
arrived at this point, than I recognised that I was thus acquiring at
the same time an abundant linguistic material, and a series of
ethnographic documents which ought to be reproduced as I had fixed
them, besides being utilised in the writing up of my account.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2285src" href="#xd26e2285" name=
"xd26e2285src">10</a> This <i lang="la">corpus inscriptionum
Kiriwiniensium</i> can be utilised, not only by myself, but by all
those who, through their better penetration and ability of interpreting
them, may find points which escape my attention, very much as the other
<i>corpora</i> form the basis for the various interpretations of
ancient and prehistoric cultures; only, these ethnographic inscriptions
are all decipherable and clear, have been almost all translated fully
and unambiguously, and have been provided with native
cross-commentaries or <i>scholia</i> obtained from living sources.</p>
<p>No more need be said on this subject here, as later on a whole
chapter (<a href="#ch18">Chapter XVIII</a>) is devoted to it, and to
its exemplification by several native texts. The <i>Corpus</i> will of
course be published separately at a later date.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Our considerations thus indicate that the goal of
ethnographic field-work must be approached through three avenues:</p>
<p>1. <i>The organisation of the tribe, and the anatomy</i> of <i>its
culture</i> must be recorded in firm, clear outline. The method of
<i>concrete, statistical documentation</i> is the means through which
such an outline has to be given.</p>
<p>2. Within this frame, the <i>imponderabilia of actual life</i>, and
the <i>type of behaviour</i> have to be filled in. They have to be
collected through minute, detailed observations, in the form of some
sort of ethnographic diary, made possible by close contact with native
life.</p>
<p>3. A collection of ethnographic statements, characteristic
narratives, typical utterances, items of folk-lore and magical
formul&aelig; has to be given as a <i lang="la">corpus
inscriptionum</i>, as documents of native mentality. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span></p>
<p>These three lines of approach lead to the final goal, of which an
Ethnographer should never lose sight. This goal is, briefly, to grasp
the native&rsquo;s point of view, his relation to life, to realise
<i>his</i> vision of <i>his</i> world. We have to study man, and we
must study what concerns him most intimately, that is, the hold which
life has on him. In each culture, the values are slightly different;
people aspire after different aims, follow different impulses, yearn
after a different form of happiness. In each culture, we find different
institutions in which man pursues his life-interest, different customs
by which he satisfies his aspirations, different codes of law and
morality which reward his virtues or punish his defections. To study
the institutions, customs, and codes or to study the behaviour and
mentality without the subjective desire of feeling by what these people
live, of realising the substance of their happiness&mdash;is, in my
opinion, to miss the greatest reward which we can hope to obtain from
the study of man.</p>
<p>These generalities the reader will find illustrated in the following
chapters. We shall see there the savage striving to satisfy certain
aspirations, to attain his type of value, to follow his line of social
ambition. We shall see him led on to perilous and difficult enterprises
by a tradition of magical and heroical exploits, shall see him
following the lure of his own romance. Perhaps as we read the account
of these remote customs there may emerge a feeling of solidarity with
the endeavours and ambitions of these natives. Perhaps man&rsquo;s
mentality will be revealed to us, and brought near, along some lines
which we never have followed before. Perhaps through realising human
nature in a shape very distant and foreign to us, we shall have some
light shed on our own. In this, and in this case only, we shall be
justified in feeling that it has been worth our while to understand
these natives, their institutions and customs, and that we have
gathered some profit from the Kula.</p>

<p class="first">The tribes who live within the sphere of the Kula
system of trading belong, one and all&mdash;with the exception perhaps,
of the Rossel Island natives, of whom we know next to nothing&mdash;to
the same racial group. These tribes inhabit the easternmost end of the
mainland of New Guinea and those islands, scattered in the form of the
long-drawn archipelago, which continue in the same south-easternly
trend as the mainland, as if to bridge over the gap between New Guinea
and the Solomons.</p>
<p>New Guinea is a mountainous island-continent, very difficult of
access in its interior, and also at certain portions of the coast,
where barrier reefs, swamps and rocks practically prevent landing or
even approach for native craft. Such a country would obviously not
offer the same opportunities in all its parts to the drifting
migrations which in all probability are responsible for the composition
of the present population of the South Seas. The easily accessible
portions of the coast and the outlying islands would certainly offer a
hospitable reception to immigrants of a higher stock; but, on the other
hand, the high hills, the impregnable fastnesses in swampy flats and
shores where landing was difficult and dangerous, would give easy
protection to the aborigines, and discourage the influx of
migrators.</p>
<p>The actual distribution of races in New Guinea completely justifies
these hypotheses. <a href="#map2">Map II</a> shows the Eastern part of
the main island and archipelagoes of New Guinea and the racial
distribution of the natives. The interior of the continent, the low
sago swamps and deltas of the Gulf of Papua&mdash;probably the greater
part of the North Coast and of the South-West Coast of New Guinea, are
inhabited by a &ldquo;relatively <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28"
href="#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>tall, dark-skinned,
frizzly-haired&rdquo; race, called by Dr. Seligman <i>Papuan</i>, and
in the hills more especially by pygmy tribes. We know little about
these people, swamp tribes and hill tribes alike, who probably are the
autochtons in this part of the world.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2374src" href="#xd26e2374" name="xd26e2374src">1</a> As we shall
also not meet them in the following account, it will be better to pass
to the tribes who inhabit the accessible parts of New Guinea.
&ldquo;The Eastern Papuasians, that is, the generally smaller, lighter
coloured, frizzly-haired races of the eastern peninsula of New Guinea
and its archipelagoes now require a name, and since the true Melanesian
element is dominant in them, they may be called Papuo-Melanesians. With
regard to these Eastern Papuasians, Dr. A. C. Haddon first recognised
that they came into the country as the result of a &lsquo;Melanesian
migration into New Guinea,&rsquo; and further, &lsquo;That a single
wandering would not account for certain puzzling
facts.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2383src" href=
"#xd26e2383" name="xd26e2383src">2</a> The Papuo-Melanesians again can
be divided into two groups, a Western and an Eastern one, which,
following Dr. Seligman&rsquo;s terminology, we shall call the Western
Papuo-Melanesians and the Massim respectively. It is with these latter
we shall become acquainted in the following pages.</p>
<p>If we glance at a map and follow the orographical features of
Eastern New Guinea and its coast line, we see at once that the high
main range of mountains drops off between the 149th and 150th
meridians, and again that the fringing reef disappears at the same
point, that is, at the west end of Orangerie Bay. This means that the
extreme East End of New Guinea, with its archipelagoes, in other words,
the Massim country, is the most easily accessible area, and might be
expected to be inhabited by a homogeneous stock of people, consisting
of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>immigrants almost unmixed with the autochtons (Cf.
<a href="#map2">Map II</a>). &ldquo;Indeed, while the condition
actually existing in the Massim area suggests that there was no slow
mingling of the invaders with a previous stock, the geographical
features of the territory of the Western Papuo-Melanesians with its
hills, mountains and swamps, are such that invaders could not have
speedily overrun the country, nor failed to have been influenced by the
original inhabitants&#8202;&hellip;&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e2393src" href="#xd26e2393" name="xd26e2393src">3</a></p>
<p>I shall assume that the reader is acquainted with the quoted work of
Dr. Seligman, where a thorough account is given of all the main types
of Papuo-Melanesian sociology and culture one after the other. But the
tribes of the Eastern Papuo-Melanesian or Massim area, must be
described here somewhat more in detail, as it is within this fairly
homogeneous area that the Kula takes place. Indeed, the Kula sphere of
influence and the ethnographic area of the Massim tribes almost
completely overlap, and we can speak about the Kula type of culture and
the Massim culture almost synonymously.</p>

<p class="first">The adjacent <a href="#map3">Map III</a> shows the
Kula district, that is, the easternmost end of the main island and the
archipelagoes lying to its East and North-East. As Professor C. G.
Seligman says: &ldquo;This area can be divided into two parts, a small
northern portion comprising the Trobriands, the Marshall Bennets, the
Woodlarks (Murua), as well as a number of smaller islands such as the
Laughlans (Nada), and a far larger southern portion comprising the
remainder of the Massim domain&rdquo; (op. cit., p. 7).</p>
<p>This division is represented on <a href="#map3">Map III</a> by the
thick line isolating to the North the Amphletts, the Trobriands, the
small Marshall Bennet Group, Woodlark Island and the Laughlan Group.
The Southern portion, I found convenient to divide further into two
divisions by a vertical line, leaving to the East Misima, Sud-Est
Island and Rossel Island. As our information about this district is
extremely scanty, I have preferred to exclude it from the area of the
Southern Massim. In this excluded area, only the natives of Misima
enter into the Kula, but their participation will play a very small
part only in the following account. The western segment, and this is
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>the part of which we shall speak as the district
of the Southern Massim, comprises first the East End of the mainland,
the few adjacent islands, Sariba, Roge&rsquo;a, Side&rsquo;a, and
Basilaki; to the South, the island of Wari, to the East the important,
though small archipelago of Tubetube (Engineer Group); and to the
North, the big archipelago of the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux Islands. From
this latter, only one district, that of Dobu, interests us more
specially. The culturally homogeneous tribes of the Southern Massim
have been marked off on our map as district V, the Doubans as district
IV.</p>

<p class="first">Map III&mdash;The Kula district. Sketch map, showing
the sub-divisions of the Massim and the principal places of importance
in the Kula.</p>
</div>
<p>Returning to the two main divisions into the Southern and Northern
portion, this latter is occupied by a very homogeneous population,
homogeneous both in language and culture, and in the clear recognition
of their own ethnic unity. To quote further Professor Seligman, it
&ldquo;is characterised by the absence of cannibalism, which, until put
down by the Government, existed throughout the remaining portion of the
district; another peculiarity of the Northern Massim is their
recognition&rdquo; in certain districts, though not in all, of
chieftains who wield extensive powers (op. cit. p. 7). The natives of
that northern area used to practise&mdash;I say used because wars are a
thing of the past&mdash;a type of warfare open and chivalrous, very
different from the raids of the Southern Massim. Their villages are
built in big compact blocks, and they have storehouses on piles for
storing food, distinct from their rather miserable dwellings, which
stand directly on the ground and are not raised on piles. As can be
seen on the map, it has been necessary to sub-divide this Northern
Massim further into three groups, first, that of the Trobriand
Islanders, or the Boyowans (the Western Branch); secondly that of the
natives of Woodlark Island and the Marshall Bennets (the Eastern
Branch); and, thirdly, the small group of the Amphlett natives.</p>
<p>The other big sub-division of the Kula tribes is composed of the
Southern Massim, of which, as just said, the western branch mainly
concerns us. These last natives are smaller in stature, and with,
broadly speaking, a much less attractive appearance than those of the
North.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2422src" href="#xd26e2422" name=
"xd26e2422src">4</a> They live in widely <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>scattered communities,
each house or group of houses standing in its own little grove of palm
and fruit trees, apart from the others. Formerly they were cannibals
and head-hunters, and used to make unexpected raids on their
adversaries. There is no chieftainship, authority being exercised by
the elders in each community. They build very elaborately constructed
and beautifully decorated houses on piles.</p>
<p>I have found it necessary for the purpose of this study to cut out
of the western branch of the southern portion of the Massim the two
areas (marked IV and V on the <a href="#map3">Map III</a>), as they are
of special importance to the Kula. It must, however, be borne in mind
that our present knowledge does not allow of any final classification
of the Southern Massim.</p>
<p>Such are the general characteristics of the Northern and Southern
Massim respectively, given in a few words. But before proceeding with
our subject, it will be good to give a short but more detailed sketch
of each of these tribes. I shall begin with the southernmost section,
following the order in which a visitor, travelling from Port Moresby
with the Mail boat, would come in contact with these districts, the way
indeed in which I received my first impressions of them. My personal
knowledge of the various tribes is, however, very uneven, based on a
long residence among the Trobriand Islanders (District I), on a
month&rsquo;s study of the Amphletts (District III); on a few weeks
spent in Woodlark Island or Murua (District II), the neighbourhood of
Samarai (District V), and the South Coast of New Guinea (also V); and
on three short visits to Dobu (District IV). My knowledge of some of
the remaining localities which enter into the Kula is derived only from
a few conversations I had with natives of this district, and on
second-hand information derived from white residents. The work of
Professor C. G. Seligman, however, supplements my personal acquaintance
in so far as the districts of Tubetube, Woodlark Island, the Marshall
Bennets, and several others are concerned.</p>
<p>The whole account of the Kula will therefore naturally be given from
the perspective, so to speak, of the Trobriand district. This district
is often called in this book by its native name, Boyowa, and the
language is spoken of as Kiriwinian, Kiriwina being the main province
of the district, and its language considered by the natives as a
standard speech. But <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33"
name="pb33">33</a>]</span>I may add at once that in studying the Kula
in that part, I <i lang="la">ipso facto</i> studied its adjacent
branches between the Trobriands and the Amphletts, between the
Trobriands and Kitava, and between the Trobriands and Dobu; seeing not
only the preparations and departures in Boyowa, but also the arrival of
the natives from other districts, in fact, following one or two of such
expeditions in person.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2441src" href=
"#xd26e2441" name="xd26e2441src">5</a> Moreover, the Kula being an
international affair, the natives of one tribe know more about Kula
customs abroad than they would about any other subject. And in all its
essentials, the customs and tribal rules of the exchange are identical
throughout the whole Kula area.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">III</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us imagine that we are sailing along the South
coast of New Guinea towards its Eastern end. At about the middle of
Orangerie Bay we arrive at the boundary of the Massim, which runs from
this point north-westwards till it strikes the northern coast near Cape
Nelson (see <a href="#map2">Map II</a>). As mentioned before, the
boundary of the district inhabited by this tribe corresponds to
definite geographical conditions, that is, to the absence of natural,
inland fastnesses, or of any obstacles to landing. Indeed, it is here
that the Great Barrier Reef becomes finally submerged, while again the
Main Range of mountains, which follows up to this point, always
separated from the foreshore by minor ranges, comes to an end.</p>
<p>Orangerie Bay is closed, on its Eastern side, by a headland, the
first of a series of hills, rising directly out of the sea. As we
approach the land, we can see distinctly the steep, folded slopes,
covered with dense, rank jungle, brightened here and there by bold
patches of lalang grass. The coast is broken first by a series of
small, land-locked bays or lagoons; then, after Fife Bay, come one or
two larger bays, with a flat, alluvial foreshore, and then from South
Cape the coast stretches in an almost unbroken line, for several miles,
to the end of the mainland.</p>
<p>The East End of New Guinea is a tropical region, where the
distinction between the dry and wet season is not felt very sharply. In
fact, there is no pronounced dry season there, and so the land is
always clad in intense, shining green, which forms a crude contrast
with the blue sea. The summits of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span>hills are often shrouded
in trailing mist, whilst white clouds brood or race over the sea,
breaking up the monotony of saturated, stiff blue and green. To someone
not acquainted with the South Sea landscape it is difficult to convey
the permanent impression of smiling festiveness, the alluring clearness
of the beach, fringed by jungle trees and palms, skirted by white foam
and blue sea, above it the slopes ascending in rich, stiff folds of
dark and light green, piebald and shaded over towards the summit by
steamy, tropical mists.</p>
<p>When I first sailed along this coast, it was after a few
months&rsquo; residence and field work in the neighbouring district of
the Mailu. From Toulon Island, the main centre and most important
settlement of the Mailu, I used to look towards the East end of
Orangerie Bay, and on clear days I could see the pyramidal hills of
Bonabona, of Gadogado&rsquo;a, as blue silhouettes in the distance.
Under the influence of my work, I came to regard this country within
the somewhat narrow native horizon, as the distant land to which
perilous, seasonal voyages are made, from whence come certain
objects&mdash;baskets, decorated carvings, weapons,
ornaments&mdash;particularly well formed, and superior to the local
ones; the land to which the natives point with awe and distrust, when
speaking of specially evil and virulent forms of sorcery; the home of a
folk mentioned with horror as cannibals. Any really fine touch of
artistic taste, in Mailu carvings, would always be directly imported or
imitated from the East, and I also found that the softest and most
melodious songs and the finest dances came from the Massim. Many of
their customs and institutions would be quoted to me as quaint and
unusual, and thus, I, the ethnographer working on the borderland of two
cultures, naturally had my interest and curiosity aroused. It seemed as
if the Eastern people must be much more complex, in one direction
towards the cruel, man-eating savage, in the other towards the
finely-gifted, poetical lord of primitive forest and seas, when I
compared them with the relatively coarse and dull native of Mailu. No
wonder, therefore, that on approaching their coast&mdash;travelling on
that occasion in a small launch&mdash;I scanned the landscape with keen
interest, anxious to catch my first glimpse of natives, or of their
traces.</p>
<p>The first distinctly visible signs of human existence in this
neighbourhood are the patches of garden land. These big <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>clearings, triangular in shape, with the apex
pointing uphill, look as if they were plastered on to the steep slopes.
From August to November, the season when the natives cut and burn the
bush, they can be seen, at night, alight with slowly-blazing logs, and
in daytime, their smoke clings over the clearings, and slowly drifts
along the hill side. Later on in the year, when the plantation sprouts,
they form a bright spot, with the light green of their fresh
leaves.</p>
<p>The villages in this district are to be found only on the foreshore,
at the foot of the hills, hidden in groves of trees, with here and
there a golden or purplish bit of thatch showing through the dark green
of the leaves. In calm weather a few canoes are probably not far off,
fishing. If the visitor is lucky enough to pass at the time of feasts,
trading expeditions, or any other big tribal gathering, many a fine
sea-going canoe may be seen approaching the village with the sound of
conch shells blowing melodiously.</p>
<p>In order to visit one of the typical, large settlements of these
natives, let us say near Fife Bay, on the South coast, or on the island
of Sariba, or Roge&rsquo;a, it would be best to go ashore in some big,
sheltered bay, or on one of the extensive beaches at the foot of a
hilly island. We enter a clear, lofty grove, composed of palms, bread
fruit, mangoes, and other fruit trees, often with a sandy subsoil, well
weeded-out and clean, where grow clumps of ornamental bushes, such as
the red-flowering hybiscus, croton or aromatic shrub. Here we find the
village. Fascinating as may be the Motuan habitations standing on high
piles in the middle of a lagoon, or the neat streets of an Aroma or
Mailu settlement, or the irregular warren of small huts on the
Trobriand coast, all these cannot compete in picturesqueness or charm
with the villages of the Southern Massim. When, on a hot day, we enter
the deep shadow of fruit trees and palms, and find ourselves in the
midst of the wonderfully designed and ornamented houses hiding here and
there in irregular groups among the green, surrounded by little
decorative gardens of shells and flowers, with pebble-bordered paths
and stone-paved sitting circles, it seems as if the visions of a
primeval, happy, savage life were suddenly realised, even if only in a
fleeting impression. Big bodies of canoes are drawn high up the beach
and covered with palm leaves; here and there nets are drying, spread
out on special <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href="#pb36" name=
"pb36">36</a>]</span>stands, and on the platforms in front of the
houses sit groups of men and women, busy at some domestic work, smoking
and chatting.</p>

</div>
<p>Walking along the paths which lead on for miles, we come every few
hundred yards on another hamlet of a few houses. Some of these are
evidently new and freshly decorated, while others are abandoned, and a
heap of broken household objects is lying on the ground, showing that
the death of one of the village elders has caused it to be deserted. As
the evening approaches, the life becomes more active, fires are
kindled, and the natives busy themselves cooking and eating food. In
the dancing season, towards dusk, groups of men and women foregather,
singing, dancing, and beating drums.</p>
<p>When we approach the natives closer and scan their personal
appearance, we are struck&mdash;if we compare them with their Western
neighbours&mdash;by the extreme lightness of their skin, their sturdy,
even lumpy stature, and a sort of soft, almost effete general
impression which their physique produces. Their fat, broad faces, their
squashed noses, and frequently oblique eyes, make them appear quaint
and grotesque rather than impressively savage. Their hair, not so
woolly as that of the pure Papuans, nor growing into the enormous halo
of the Motuans, is worn in big mops, which they often cut at the sides
so as to give the head an oblong, almost cylindrical shape. Their
manner is shy and diffident, but not unfriendly&mdash;rather smiling
and almost servile, in very great contrast to the morose Papuan, or the
unfriendly, reserved South Coast Mailu or Aroma. On the whole, they
give at first approach not so much the impression of wild savages as of
smug and self-satisfied bourgeois.</p>
<p>Their ornaments are much less elaborate and more toned down than
those of their Western neighbours. Belts and armlets plaited of a dark
brown fern vine, small red shell disks and turtle shell rings as ear
ornaments are the only permanent, every-day decorations worn. Like all
Melanesians of Eastern New Guinea, they are quite cleanly in their
persons, and a personal approach to them does not offend any of our
senses. They are very fond of red hibiscus flowers stuck in their hair,
of scented flower wreaths on their head, of aromatic leaves thrust into
their belts and armlets. Their grand, festive head-dress is extremely
modest compared with the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href=
"#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>enormous erections of feathers used
by the Western tribes, and consists mainly of a round halo of white
cockatoo feathers stuck into their hair (see <a href="#pl05">Plate
V</a> and <a href="#pl06">VI</a>).</p>
<p>In olden days, before the advent of white men, these pleasant,
apparently effete people were inveterate cannibals and head-hunters,
and in their large war-canoes they carried on treacherous, cruel raids,
falling upon sleeping villages, killing man, woman and child, and
feasting on their bodies. The attractive stone circles in their
villages were associated with their cannibal feasts.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e2532src" href="#xd26e2532" name="xd26e2532src">6</a></p>
<p>The traveller, who could settle down in one of their villages and
remain there sufficiently long to study their habits and enter into
their tribal life, would soon be struck by the absence of a well
recognised general authority. In this, however, the natives resemble
not only the other Western Melanesians of New Guinea, but also the
natives of the Melanesian Archipelago. The authority in the Southern
Massim tribe, as in many others, is vested in the village elders. In
each hamlet the eldest man has a position of personal influence and
power, and these collectively would in all cases represent the tribe
and carry out and enforce their decisions&mdash;always arrived at in
strict accord with tribal tradition.</p>
<p>Deeper sociological study would reveal the characteristic totemism
of these natives, and also the matrilineal construction of their
society. Descent, inheritance, and social position follow the female
line&mdash;a man always belongs to his mother&rsquo;s totemic division
and local group, and inherits from his mother&rsquo;s brother. Women
also enjoy a very independent position, and are exceedingly well
treated, and in tribal and festive affairs they play a prominent part
(see Plates <a href="#pl05">V</a> and <a href="#pl06">VI</a>). Some
women, even, owing to their magical powers, wield a considerable
influence.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2545src" href="#xd26e2545" name=
"xd26e2545src">7</a></p>
<p>The sexual life of these natives is extremely lax. Even when we
remember the very free standard of sex morals in the Melanesian tribes
of New Guinea, such as the Motu or the Mailu, we still find these
natives exceedingly loose in such matters. Certain reserves and
appearances which are usually kept up in other tribes, are here
completely abandoned. As is probably the case in many communities where
sex morals are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38" name=
"pb38">38</a>]</span>lax, there is a complete absence of unnatural
practices and sex perversions. Marriage is concluded as the natural end
of a long and lasting liaison.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2552src"
href="#xd26e2552" name="xd26e2552src">8</a></p>
<p>These natives are efficient and industrious manufacturers, and great
traders. They own large sea-going canoes, which, however, they do not
manufacture themselves, but which they import from the Northern Massim
district, or from Panayati. Another feature of their culture, which we
shall meet again, consists of their big feasts, called <i lang=
"kij">So&rsquo;i</i> (see Plates <a href="#pl05">V</a> and <a href=
"#pl06">VI</a>), associated with mortuary celebrations and with a
special mortuary taboo called <i lang="kij">gwara</i>. In the big
inter-tribal trading of the Kula, these feasts play a considerable
r&ocirc;le.</p>
<p>This general, and necessarily somewhat superficial description, is
meant to give the reader a definite impression of these tribes, provide
them, so to speak, with a physiognomy, rather than to give a full
account of their tribal constitution. For this the reader is referred
to Professor C. G. Seligman&rsquo;s treatise, our main source of
knowledge on the Melanesians of New Guinea. The above sketch refers to
what Professor Seligman calls the Southern Massim, or more exactly to
the portion marked off in the Ethnographic sketch <a href="#map3">Map
No. III</a> as &ldquo;V, the Southern Massim&rdquo;&mdash;the
inhabitants of the Easternmost mainland and the adjacent
archipelago.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us now move North, towards the district marked
&ldquo;IV, the Dobu,&rdquo; in our map, which forms one of the most
important links in the chain of Kula and a very influential centre of
cultural influence. As we sail North, passing East Cape, the
Easternmost point of the main island&mdash;a long, flat promontory
covered with palms and fruit belts, and harbouring a very dense
population&mdash;a new world, new both geographically and
ethnographically, opens up before us. At first it is only a faint,
bluish silhouette, like a shadow of a distant mountain range, hovering
far north over the horizon. As we approach, the hills of Normanby, the
nearest of three big islands of the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux Archipelago,
become clearer and take more definite shape and substance. A few high
summits stand out more distinctly through the usual tropical haze,
among them the characteristic double-peaked top of Bwebweso, the
mountain <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=
"pb39">39</a>]</span>where, according to native legend, the spirits of
the dead in these parts lead their latter existence. The South Coast of
Normanby, and the interior are inhabited by a tribe or tribes of which
we know nothing ethnographically, except that they differ culturally
from the rest of their neighbours. These tribes also take no direct
part in the Kula.</p>
<p>The Northern end of Normanby, both sides of the Dawson Straits which
separate the two islands of Normanby and Fergusson, and the
South-eastern tip of Fergusson, are inhabited by a very important
tribe, the Dobu. The heart of their district is the small extinct
volcano forming an island at the Eastern entrance to Dawson
Straits&mdash;Dobu, after which island they are named. To reach it, we
have to sail through this extremely picturesque channel. On either side
of the winding, narrow strait, green hills descend, and close it in,
till it is more like a mountain lake. Here and there they recede, and a
lagoon opens out. Or again they rise in fairly steep slopes, on which
there can be plainly seen triangular gardens, native houses on piles,
large tracts of unbroken jungle and patches of grass land. As we
proceed, the narrow straits broaden, and we see on our right a wide
flank of Mt. Sulomona&rsquo;i on Normanby Island. On our left, there is
a shallow bay, and behind it a large, flat plain, stretching far into
the interior of Fergusson Island, and over it, we look into wide
valleys, and on to several distant mountain ranges. After another turn,
we enter a big bay, on both sides bordered by a flat foreshore, and in
the middle of it rises out of a girdle of tropical vegetation, the
creased cone of an extinct volcano, the island of Dobu.</p>
<p>We are now in the centre of a densely populated and ethnographically
important district. From this island, in olden days, fierce and daring
cannibal and head-hunting expeditions were periodically launched, to
the dread of the neighbouring tribes. The natives of the immediately
surrounding districts, of the flat foreshore on both sides of the
straits, and of the big neighbouring islands were allies. But the more
distant districts, often over a hundred miles away by sail, never felt
safe from the Dobuans. Again, this was, and still is, one of the main
links in the Kula, a centre of trade, industries and general cultural
influence. It is characteristic of the international position of the
Dobuans that their language is spoken as a lingua franca all over the
d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40"
name="pb40">40</a>]</span>Archipelago, in the Amphletts, and as far
north as the Trobriands. In the southern part of these latter islands,
almost everyone speaks Dobuan, although in Dobu the language of the
Trobriands or Kiriwinian is hardly spoken by anyone. This is a
remarkable fact, which cannot be easily explained in terms of the
present conditions, as the Trobrianders, if anything, are on a higher
level of cultural development than Dobuans, are more numerous, and
enjoy the same general prestige.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2587src"
href="#xd26e2587" name="xd26e2587src">9</a></p>
<p>Another remarkable fact about Dobu and its district is that it is
studded with spots of special, mythological interest. Its charming
scenery, of volcanic cones, of wide, calm bays, and lagoons overhung by
lofty, green mountains, with the reef-riddled, island-strewn ocean on
the North, has deep, legendary meaning for the native. Here is the land
and sea where the magically inspired sailors and heroes of the dim past
performed feats of daring and power. As we sail from the entrance into
Dawson Straits, through Dobu and the Amphletts to Boyowa, almost every
new configuration of the land which we pass is the scene of some
legendary exploit. Here the narrow gorge has been broken through by a
magic canoe flying in the air. There the two rocks standing in the sea
are the petrified bodies of two mythological heroes who were stranded
at this spot after a quarrel. Here again, a land-locked lagoon has been
a port of refuge to a mythical crew. Apart from its legends, the
scenery before us, fine as it is, derives still more charm from the
knowledge that it is, and has been a distant Eldorado, a land of
promise and hope to generation after generation of really daring native
sailors from the Northern islands. And in the past these lands and seas
must have been the scene of migrations and fights, of tribal invasions,
and of gradual infiltrations of peoples and cultures.</p>
<p>In personal appearance, the Dobuans have a very distinct physique,
which differentiates them sharply from the Southern Massim and from the
Trobrianders; very dark-skinned, small of stature, with big heads and
rounded shoulders, they give a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41"
href="#pb41" name="pb41">41</a>]</span>strange, almost gnome-like
impression on a first encounter. In their manner, and their tribal
character, there is something definitely pleasant, honest and
open&mdash;an impression which long acquaintance with them confirms and
strengthens. They are the general favourites of the whites, form the
best and most reliable servants, and traders who have resided long
among them compare them favourably with other natives.</p>
<p>Their villages, like those of the previously described Massim, are
scattered over wide areas. The fertile and flat foreshores which they
inhabit are studded with small, compact hamlets of a dozen or so
houses, hidden in the midst of one continuous plantation of fruit
trees, palms, bananas and yams. The houses are built on piles, but are
cruder architecturally than those of the S. Massim, and almost without
any decorations, though in the olden days of head-hunting some of them
were ornamented with skulls.</p>
<p>In their social constitution, the people are totemic, being divided
into a number of exogamous clans with linked totems. There is no
institution of regular chieftainship, nor have they any system of rank
or caste such as we shall meet in the Trobriands. Authority is vested
in the elders of the tribe. In each hamlet there is a man who wields
the greatest influence locally, and acts as its representative on such
tribal councils as may arise in connection with ceremonies and
expeditions.</p>
<p>Their system of kinship is matrilineal, and women hold a very good
position, and wield great influence. They also seem to take a much more
permanent and prominent part in tribal life than is the case among the
neighbouring populations. There is notably one of the features of
Dobuan society, which seems to strike the Trobrianders as peculiar, and
to which they will direct attention while giving information, even
although in the Trobriands also women have a good enough social
position. In Dobu, women take an important part in gardening, and have
a share in performing garden magic, and this in itself gives them a
high status. Again, the main instrument for wielding power and
inflicting penalties in these lands, sorcery, is to a great extent in
the hands of women. The flying witches, so characteristic of the
Eastern New Guinea type of culture, here have one of their strongholds.
We shall have to go into this subject more in detail when speaking
about shipwreck and the dangers of sailing. Besides this, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name="pb42">42</a>]</span>women
practice ordinary sorcery, which in other tribes is only man&rsquo;s
prerogative.</p>
<p>As a rule, amongst natives, a high position of women is associated
with sex laxity. In this, Dobu is an exception. Not only are married
women expected to remain faithful, and adultery considered a great
crime, but, in sharp contrast to all surrounding tribes, the unmarried
girls of Dobu remain strictly chaste. There are no ceremonial or
customary forms of licence, and an intrigue would be certainly regarded
as an offence.</p>
<p>A few more words must be said here about sorcery, as this is a
matter of great importance in all inter-tribal relations. The dread of
sorcery is enormous, and when the natives visit distant parts, this
dread is enhanced by the additional awe of the unknown and foreign.
Besides the flying witches, there are, in Dobu, men and women who, by
their knowledge of magical spells and rites, can inflict disease and
cause death. The methods of these sorcerers, and all the beliefs
clustering round this subject are very much the same as those in the
Trobriands which we shall meet later on. These methods are
characterised by being very rational and direct, and implying hardly
any supernatural element. The sorcerer has to utter a spell over some
substance, and this must be administered by mouth, or else burnt over
the fire in the victim&rsquo;s hut. The pointing stick is also used by
the sorcerers in certain rites.</p>
<p>If his methods are compared with those used by flying witches, who
eat the heart and lungs, drink the blood, snap the bones of their
enemies, and moreover possess the powers of invisibility and of flying,
the Dobuan sorcerer seems to have but simple and clumsy means at his
disposal. He is also very much behind his Mailu or Motu
namesakes&mdash;I say namesakes, because sorcerers throughout the
Massim are called <i lang="kij">Bara&rsquo;u</i>, and the same word is
used in Mailu, while the Motu use the reduplicated <i lang=
"kij">Babara&rsquo;u</i>. The magicians in these parts use such
powerful methods as those of killing the victim first, opening up the
body, removing, lacerating or charming the inside, then bringing the
victim to life again, only that he may soon sicken and eventually
die.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2617src" href="#xd26e2617" name=
"xd26e2617src">10</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43"
name="pb43">43</a>]</span></p>
<p>According to Dobuan belief, the spirits of the dead go to the top of
Mt. Bwebweso on Normanby Island. This confined space harbours the
shades of practically all the natives of the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux
Archipelago, except those of Northern Goodenough Island, who, as I was
told by some local informants, go after death to the spirit land of the
Trobrianders.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2626src" href="#xd26e2626"
name="xd26e2626src">11</a> The Dobuans have also the belief in a double
soul&mdash;one, shadowy and impersonal, surviving the bodily death for
a few days only, and remaining in the vicinity of the grave, the other
the real spirit, who goes to Bwebweso.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note how natives, living on the boundary
between two cultures and between two types of belief, regard the
ensuing differences. A native of, say, Southern Boyowa, confronted with
the question:&mdash;how it is that the Dobuans place spirit-land on
Bwebweso, whereas they, the Trobrianders, place it in Tuma?&mdash;does
not see any difficulty in solving the problem. He does not regard the
difference as due to a dogmatic conflict in doctrine. Quite simply he
answers:&mdash;&ldquo;Their dead go to Bwebweso and ours to
Tuma.&rdquo; The metaphysical laws of existence are not yet considered
subject to one invariable truth. As human destinies in life change,
according to varieties in tribal custom, so also the doings of the
spirit! An interesting theory is evolved to harmonise the two beliefs
in a mixed case. There is a belief that if a Trobriander were to die in
Dobu, when on a Kula expedition, he would go for a time to Bwebweso. In
due season, the spirits of the Trobrianders would sail from Tuma, the
spirit land, to Bwebweso, on a spirit Kula, and the newly departed one
would join their party and sail with them back to Tuma.</p>
<p>On leaving Dobu, we sail the open sea, a sea studded with coral
patches and sand-banks, and seamed with long barrier reefs, where
treacherous tides, running sometimes as much as five knots, make
sailing really dangerous, especially for helpless native craft. This is
the Kula sea, the scene of the inter-tribal expeditions and adventures
which will be the theme of our future descriptions.</p>
<p>The Eastern shore of Ferguson Island, near Dobu, along which we are
sailing, consists first of a series of volcanic cones and capes, giving
the landscape the aspect of something <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>unfinished and crudely
put together. At the foot of the hills there stretches for several
miles beyond Dobu a broad alluvial flat covered with
villages&mdash;Deide&rsquo;i, Tu&rsquo;utauna, Bwayowa, all important
centres of trade, and the homes of the direct Kula partners of the
Trobrianders. Heavy fumes can be seen floating above the jungle, coming
from the hot geysers of Deide&rsquo;i, which spurt up in high jets
every few minutes.</p>
<p>Soon we come abreast of two characteristically shaped, dark rocks,
one half hidden in the vegetation of the shore, the other standing in
the sea at the end of a narrow sand-spit dividing the two. These are
Atu&rsquo;a&rsquo;ine and Aturamo&rsquo;a, two men turned into stone,
as mythical tradition has it. Here the big sailing expeditions, those
starting northwards from Dobu, as well as those arriving from the
North, still make a halt&mdash;just as they have done for centuries,
and, under observation of many taboos, give sacrificial offerings to
the stones, with ritual invocations for propitious trade.</p>
<p>In the lee of these two rocks, runs a small bay with a clean, sandy
beach, called Sarubwoyna. Here a visitor, lucky enough to pass at the
right moment of the right season would see a picturesque and
interesting scene. There before him would lie a huge fleet of some
fifty to a hundred canoes, anchored in the shallow water, with swarms
of natives upon them, all engaged in some strange and mysterious task.
Some of these, bent over heaps of herbs, would be mumbling
incantations; others would be painting and adorning their bodies. An
onlooker of two generations ago coming upon the same scene would no
doubt have been led to suspect that he was watching the preparations
for some dramatic tribal contest, for one of those big onslaughts in
which the existence of whole villages and tribes were wiped out. It
would even have been difficult for him to discern from the behaviour of
the natives whether they were moved more by fear or by the spirit of
aggression, as both these passions might have been read&mdash;and
correctly so&mdash;into their attitudes and movements. That the scene
contained no element of warfare; that this fleet had come here from
about a hundred miles sailing distance on a well regulated tribal
visit; that it had drawn up here for the final and most important
preparations&mdash;this would not have been an easy guess to make.
Nowadays&mdash;for this is carried out to this day with undiminished
pomp&mdash;it would be an equally <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"
href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>picturesque, but of course,
tamer affair, since the romance of danger has gone from native life. As
we learn in the course of this study to know more about these natives,
their general ways and customs, and more especially about their Kula
cycle of beliefs, ideas and sentiments, we shall be able to look with
understanding eyes upon this scene, and comprehend this mixture of awe
with intense, almost aggressive eagerness and this behaviour, which
appears cowed and fierce at the same time.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Immediately after leaving Sarubwoyna and rounding the
promontory of the two rocks, we come in sight of the island of Sanaroa,
a big, sprawling, coral flat, with a range of volcanic hills on its
western side. On the wide lagoon to the East of this island are the
fishing grounds, where year after year the Trobrianders, returning from
Dobu, look for the valuable spondylus shell, which, after their arrival
home, is worked into the red discs, which form one of the main objects
of native wealth. In the North of Sanaroa there is a stone in one of
the tidal creeks called Sinatemubadiye&rsquo;i, once a woman, the
sister of Atu&rsquo;a&rsquo;ine and Aturamo&rsquo;a, who, with her
brothers came in here and was petrified before the last stage of the
journey. She also receives offerings from canoes, coming either way on
Kula expeditions.</p>
<p>Sailing further, some fine scenery unfolds itself on our left, where
the high mountain range comes nearer to the sea shore, and where small
bays, deep valleys and wooded slopes succeed one another. By carefully
scanning the slopes, we can see small batches of some three to six
miserable huts. These are the dwellings of the inhabitants, who are of
a distinctly lower culture than the Dobuans, take no part in the Kula,
and in olden days were the cowed and unhappy victims of their
neighbours.</p>
<p>On our right there emerge behind Sanaroa the islands of Uwama and
Tewara, the latter inhabited by Dobuan natives. Tewara is of interest
to us, because one of the myths which we shall get to know later on
makes it the cradle of the Kula. As we sail on, rounding one after the
other the Eastern promontories of Fergusson Island, a group of strongly
marked monumental profiles appears far on the horizon from behind the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>receding headlands. These are the Amphlett
Islands, the link, both geographically and culturally, between the
coastal tribes of the volcanic region of Dobu and the inhabitants of
the flat coral archipelago of the Trobriands. This portion of the sea
is very picturesque, and has a charm of its own even in this land of
fine and varied scenery. On the main island of Fergusson, overlooking
the Amphletts from the South, and ascending straight out of the sea in
a slim and graceful pyramid, lies the tall mountain of Koyatabu, the
highest peak on the island. Its big, green surface is cut in half by
the white ribbon of a watercourse, starting almost half-way up and
running down to the sea. Scattered under the lea of Koyatabu are the
numerous smaller and bigger islands of the Amphlett
Archipelago&mdash;steep, rocky hills, shaped into pyramids,
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2654" title=
"Source: sphynxes">sphinxes</span> and cupolas, the whole a strange and
picturesque assemblage of characteristic forms.</p>

<p>The sea-front of the main village on Gumasila (or Gumawana). (See
<a href="#div1.5">Div. V.</a>)</p>
</div>
<p>With a strong South-Easterly wind, which blows here for three
quarters of the year, we approach the islands very fast, and the two
most important ones, Gumawana and Ome&rsquo;a, almost seem to leap out
of the mist. As we anchor in front of Gumawana village at the S.E. end
of the island, we cannot but feel impressed. Built on a narrow strip of
foreshore, open to the breakers, and squeezed down to the water&rsquo;s
edge by an almost precipitously rising jungle at its back, the village
has been made sea-proof by walls of stone surrounding the houses with
several bulwarks, and by stone dykes forming small artificial harbours
along the sea front. The shabby and unornamented huts, built on piles,
look very picturesque in these surroundings (see Plates <a href=
"#pl07">VII</a> and <a href="#pl43">XLIII</a>).</p>
<p>The inhabitants of this village, and of the four remaining ones in
the archipelago, are a queer people. They are a numerically weak tribe,
easily assailable from the sea, getting hardly enough to eat from their
rocky islands; and yet, through their unique skill in pottery, their
great daring and efficiency as sailors, and their central position half
way between Dobu and the Trobriands, they have succeeded in becoming in
several respects the monopolists of this part of the world. They have
also the main characteristics of monopolists: grasping and mean,
inhospitable and greedy, keen on keeping the trade and exchange in
their own hands, yet unprepared to make any sacrifice towards improving
it; shy, yet arrogant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47" href="#pb47"
name="pb47">47</a>]</span>to anyone who has any dealings with them;
they contrast unfavourably with their southern and northern neighbours.
And this is not only the white man&rsquo;s impression.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e2681src" href="#xd26e2681" name=
"xd26e2681src">12</a> The Trobrianders, as well as the Dobuans, give
the Amphlett natives a very bad name, as being stingy and unfair in all
Kula transactions, and as having no real sense of generosity and
hospitality.</p>
<p>When our boat anchors there, the natives approach it in their
canoes, offering clay pots for sale. But if we want to go ashore and
have a look at their village, there is a great commotion, and all the
women disappear from the open places. The younger ones run and hide in
the jungle behind the village, and even the old hags conceal themselves
in the houses. So that if we want to see the making of pottery, which
is almost exclusively women&rsquo;s work, we must first lure some old
woman out of her retreat with generous promises of tobacco and
assurances of honourable intentions.</p>
<p>This has been mentioned here, because it is of ethnographic
interest, as it is not only white men who inspire this shyness; if
native strangers, coming from a distance for trade, put in for a short
time in the Amphletts, the women also disappear in this fashion. This
very ostentatious coyness is, however, not a sham, because in the
Amphletts, even more than in Dobu, married and unmarried life is
characterised by strict chastity and fidelity. Women here have also a
good deal of influence, and take a great part in gardening and the
performance of garden magic. In social institutions and customs, the
natives present a mixture of Northern and Southern Massim elements.
There are no chiefs, but influential elders wield authority, and in
each village there is a head man who takes the lead in ceremonies and
other big tribal affairs. Their totemic clans are identical with those
of Murua (District II). Their somewhat precarious food supply comes
partly from the poor gardens, partly from fishing with kite and fish
trap, which, however, can only seldom be carried out, and does not
yield very much. They are not self-supporting, and receive, in form of
presents and by trade, a good deal of vegetable food as well as pigs
from the mainland, from Dobu and the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb48" href="#pb48" name="pb48">48</a>]</span>Trobriands. In personal
appearance they are very much like the Trobrianders, that is, taller
than the Dobuans, lighter skinned, and with finer features.</p>
<p>We must now leave the Amphletts and proceed to the Trobriand
Islands, the scene of most of the occurrences described in this book,
and the country concerning which I possess by far the largest amount of
ethnographic information.</p>

<p class="first">Leaving the bronzed rocks and the dark jungle of the
Amphletts for the present&mdash;for we shall have to revisit them in
the course of our study, and then shall learn more about their
inhabitants&mdash;we sail North into an entirely different world of
flat coral islands; into an ethnographic district, which stands out by
ever so many peculiar manners and customs from the rest of
Papuo-Melanesia. So far, we have sailed over intensely blue, clear
seas, where in shallow places the coral bottom, with its variety of
colour and form, with its wonderful plant and fish life, is a
fascinating spectacle in itself&mdash;a sea framed in all the
splendours of tropical jungle, of volcanic and mountainous scenery,
with lively watercourses and falls, with steamy clouds trailing in the
high valleys. From all this we take a final farewell as we sail North.
The outlines of the Amphletts soon fade away in tropical haze, till
only Koyatabu&rsquo;s slender pyramid, lifted over them, remains on the
horizon, the graceful form, which follows us even as far as the Lagoon
of Kiriwina.</p>
<p>We now enter an opaque, greenish sea, whose monotony is broken only
by a few sandbanks, some bare and awash, others with a few pandanus
trees squatting on their air roots, high in the sand. To these banks,
the Amphlett natives come and there they spend weeks on end, fishing
for turtle and dugong. Here is also laid the scene of several of the
mythical incidents of primeval Kula. Further ahead, through the misty
spray, the line of horizon thickens here and there, as if faint pencil
marks had been drawn upon it. These become more substantial, one of
them lengthens and broadens, the others spring into the distinct shapes
of small islands, and we find ourselves in the big Lagoon of the
Trobriands, with Boyowa, the largest island, on our right, and with
many others, inhabited and uninhabited, to the North and
North-West.</p>

the shallows, and as we approach the main island, the thick, tangled
matting of the low jungle breaks here and there over a beach, and we
can see into a palm grove, like an interior, supported by pillars. This
indicates the site of a village. We step ashore on to the sea front, as
a rule covered with mud and refuse, with canoes drawn up high and dry,
and passing through the grove, we enter the village itself (see
<a href="#pl08">Plate VIII</a>).</p>
<p>Soon we are seated on one of the platforms built in front of a
yam-house, shaded by its overhanging roof. The round, grey logs, worn
smooth by contact with naked feet and bodies; the trodden ground of the
village-street; the brown skins of the natives, who immediately
surround the visitor in large groups&mdash;all these form a colour
scheme of bronze and grey, <span class="corr" id="xd26e2756" title=
"Source: unforgetable">unforgettable</span> to anyone, who, like
myself, has lived among these people.</p>
<p>It is difficult to convey the feelings of intense interest and
suspense with which an Ethnographer enters for the first time the
district that is to be the future scene of his field-work. Certain
salient features, characteristic of the place, at once rivet his
attention, and fill him with hopes or apprehensions. The appearance of
the natives, their manners, their types of behaviour, may augur well or
ill for the possibilities of rapid and easy research. One is on the
lookout for symptoms of deeper, sociological facts, one suspects many
hidden and mysterious ethnographic phenomena behind the commonplace
aspect of things. Perhaps that queer-looking, intelligent native is a
renowned sorcerer; perhaps between those two groups of men there exists
some important rivalry or vendetta which may throw much light on the
customs and character of the people if one can only lay hands upon it?
Such at least were my thoughts and feelings as on the day of my arrival
in Boyowa I sat scanning a chatting group of Trobriand natives.</p>
<p>The great variety in their physical appearance is what strikes one
first in Boyowa.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e2763src" href="#xd26e2763"
name="xd26e2763src">1</a> There are men and women of tall stature, fine
bearing, and delicate features, with clear-cut aquiline profile and
high foreheads, well formed nose and chin, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>and an
open, intelligent expression (see Plates <a href="#pl09">IX</a>,
<a href="#pl15">XV</a>, <a href="#pl17">XVII</a>). And besides these,
there are others with <span class="corr" id="xd26e2778" title=
"Source: prognatic">prognathic</span>, negroid faces, broad,
thick-lipped mouths, narrow foreheads, and a coarse expression (see
Plates <a href="#pl10">X</a>, <a href="#pl11">XI</a>, <a href=
"#pl12">XII</a>). The better featured have also a markedly lighter
skin. Even their hair differs, varying from quite straight locks to the
frizzly mop of the typical Melanesian. They wear the same classes of
ornaments as the other Massim, consisting mainly of fibre armlets and
belts, earrings of turtle shell and spondylus discs, and they are very
fond of using, for personal decoration, flowers and aromatic herbs. In
manner they are much freer, more familiar and confident, than any of
the natives we have so far met. As soon as an interesting stranger
arrives, half the village assembles around him, talking loudly and
making remarks about him, frequently uncomplimentary, and altogether
assuming a tone of jocular familiarity.</p>

<p>One of the main sociological features at once strikes an observant
newcomer&mdash;the existence of rank and social differentiation. Some
of the natives&mdash;very frequently those of the finer looking
type&mdash;are treated with most marked deference by others, and in
return, these chiefs and persons of rank behave in quite a different
way towards the strangers. In fact, they show excellent manners in the
full meaning of this word.</p>
<p>When a chief is present, no commoner dares to remain in a physically
higher position; he has to bend his body or squat. Similarly, when the
chief sits down, no one would dare to stand. The institution of
definite chieftainship, to which are shown such extreme marks of
deference, with a sort of rudimentary Court ceremonial, with insignia
of rank and authority, is so entirely foreign to the whole spirit of
Melanesian tribal life, that at first sight it transports the
Ethnographer into a different world. In the course of our inquiry, we
shall constantly meet with manifestation of the Kiriwinian
chief&rsquo;s authority, we shall notice the difference in this respect
between the Trobrianders and the other tribes, and the resulting
adjustments of tribal usage.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another sociological feature, which forcibly obtrudes
itself on the visitor&rsquo;s notice is the social position of the
women. Their behaviour, after the cool aloofness of the Dobuan women,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name=
"pb53">53</a>]</span>and the very uninviting treatment which strangers
receive from those of the Amphletts, comes almost as a shock in its
friendly familiarity. Naturally, here also, the manners of women of
rank are quite different from those of low class commoners. But, on the
whole, high and low alike, though by no means reserved, have a genial,
pleasant approach, and many of them are very fine-looking (see Plates
<a href="#pl11">XI</a>, <a href="#pl12">XII</a>). Their dress is also
different from any so far observed. All the Melanesian women in New
Guinea wear a petticoat made of fibre. Among the Southern Massim, this
fibre skirt is long, reaching to the knees or below, whereas in the
Trobriands it is much shorter and fuller, consisting of several layers
standing out round the body like a ruff (compare the S. Massim women on
Plates <a href="#pl05">V</a> and <a href="#pl06">VI</a> with the
Trobrianders on <a href="#pl04">Plate IV</a>). The highly ornamental
effect of that dress is enhanced by the elaborate decorations made in
three colours on the several layers forming the top skirt. On the
whole, it is very becoming to fine young women, and gives to small
slender girls a graceful, elfish appearance.</p>
<p>Chastity is an unknown virtue among these natives. At an incredibly
early age they become initiated into sexual life, and many of the
innocent looking plays of childhood are not as innocuous as they
appear. As they grow up, they live in promiscuous free-love, which
gradually develops into more permanent attachments, one of which ends
in marriage. But before this is reached, unmarried girls are openly
supposed to be quite free to do what they like, and there are even
ceremonial arrangements by which the girls of a village repair in a
body to another place; there they publicly range themselves for
inspection, and each is chosen by a local boy, with whom she spends a
night. This is called <i lang="kij">katuyausi</i> (see <a href=
"#pl12">Plate XII</a>). Again, when a visiting party arrives from
another district, food is brought to them by the unmarried girls, who
are also expected to satisfy their sexual wants. At the big mortuary
vigils round the corpse of a newly deceased person, people from
neighbouring villages come in large bodies to take part in the wailing
and singing. The girls of the visiting party are expected by usage to
comfort the boys of the bereaved village, in a manner which gives much
anguish to their official lovers. There is another remarkable form of
ceremonial licence, in which indeed women are openly the initiators.
During the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>gardening season, at the time of weeding, the
women do communal work, and any strange man who ventures to pass
through the district runs a considerable risk, for the women will run
after him, seize him, tear off his pubic leaf, and ill-treat him
orgiastically in the most <span class="corr" id="xd26e2858" title=
"Source: ignominous">ignominious</span> manner. Side by side with these
ceremonial forms of licence, there go, in the normal course of events,
constant private intrigues, more intense during the festive seasons,
becoming less prominent as garden work, trading expeditions, or
harvesting take up the energies and attention of the tribe.</p>
<p>Marriage is associated with hardly any public or private rite or
ceremony. The woman simply joins her husband in his house, and later
on, there is a series of exchanges of gifts, which in no way can be
interpreted as purchase money for the wife. As a matter of fact, the
most important feature of the Trobriand marriage is the fact that the
wife&rsquo;s family have to contribute, and that in a very substantial
manner, to the economics of her household, and also they have to
perform all sorts of services for the husband. In her married life, the
woman is supposed to remain faithful to her husband, but this rule is
neither very strictly kept nor enforced. In all other ways, she retains
a great measure of independence, and her husband has to treat her well
and with consideration. If he does not, the woman simply leaves him and
returns to her family, and as the husband is as a rule economically the
loser by her action, he has to exert himself to get her
back&mdash;which he does by means of presents and persuasions. If she
chooses, she can leave him for good, and she can always find someone
else to marry.</p>
<p>In tribal life, the position of women is also very high. They do not
as a rule join the councils of men, but in many matters they have their
own way, and control several aspects of tribal life. Thus, some of the
garden work is their business; and this is considered a privilege as
well as a duty. They also look after certain stages in the big,
ceremonial divisions of food, associated with the very complete and
elaborate mortuary ritual of the Boyowans (see <a href="#pl04">Plate
IV</a>). Certain forms of magic&mdash;that performed over a first-born
baby, beauty-magic made at tribal ceremonies, some classes of
sorcery&mdash;are also the monopoly of women. Women of rank share the
privileges incidental to it, and men of low caste will bend before them
and observe all the necessary formalities and taboos due <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name="pb55">55</a>]</span>to a
chief. A woman of chief&rsquo;s rank, married to commoner, retains her
status, even with regard to her husband, and has to be treated
accordingly.</p>
<p>The Trobrianders are matrilineal, that is, in tracing descent and
settling inheritance, they follow the maternal line. A child belongs to
the clan and village community of its mother, and wealth, as well as
social position, are inherited, not from father to son, but from
maternal uncle to nephew. This rule admits of certain important and
interesting exceptions, which we shall come across in the course of
this study.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Returning to our imaginary first visit ashore, the
next interesting thing to do, after we have sufficiently taken in the
appearance and manners of the natives, is to walk round the village. In
doing this, again we would come across much, which to a trained eye,
would reveal at once deeper sociological facts. In the Trobriands,
however, it would be better to make our first observations in one of
the large, inland villages, situated on even, flat ground with plenty
of space, so that it has been possible to build it in the typical
pattern. In the coastal villages, placed on marshy ground and coral
outcrop, the irregularity of the soil and cramped space have
obliterated the design, and they present quite a chaotic appearance.
The big villages of the central districts, on the other hands, are
built one and all with an almost geometrical regularity.</p>
<p>In the middle, a big circular space is surrounded by a ring of yam
houses. These latter are built on piles, and present a fine, decorative
front, with walls of big, round logs, laid crosswise on one another, so
as to leave wide interstices through which the stored yams can be seen
(see Plates <a href="#pl15">XV</a>, <a href="#pl32">XXXII</a>, <a href=
"#pl33">XXXIII</a>). Some of the store-houses strike us at once as
being better built, larger, and higher than the rest, and these have
also big, ornamented boards, running round the gable and across it.
These are the yam houses of the chief or of persons of rank. Each yam
house also has, as a rule, a small platform in front of it, on which
groups of men will sit and chat in the evening, and where visitors can
rest.</p>
<p>Concentrically with the circular row of yam houses, there runs a
ring of dwelling huts, and thus a street going all round the village is
formed between the two rows (see Plates <a href="#pl03">III</a>,
<a href="#pl04">IV</a>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href=
"#pb56" name="pb56">56</a>]</span><a href="#pl08">VIII</a>). The
dwellings are lower than the yam houses, and instead of being on piles,
are built directly on the ground. The interior is dark and very stuffy,
and the only opening into it is through the door, and that is usually
closed. Each hut is occupied by one family (see <a href="#pl15">Plate
XV</a>), that is, husband, wife and small children, while adolescent
and grown-up boys and girls live in separate small bachelor&rsquo;s
houses, harbouring some two to six inmates. Chiefs and people of rank
have their special, personal houses, besides those of their wives. The
Chief&rsquo;s house often stands in the central ring of the
store-houses facing the main place.</p>

</div>
<p>The broad inspection of the village would therefore reveal to us the
r&ocirc;le of decoration as insignia of rank, the existence of
bachelors&rsquo; and spinsters&rsquo; houses, the great importance
attached to the yam-harvest&mdash;all these small symptoms which,
followed up, would lead us deep into the problems of native sociology.
Moreover, such an inspection would have led us to inquire as to the
part played by the different divisions of the village in tribal life.
We should then learn that the <i lang="kij">baku</i>, the central
circular space, is the scene of public ceremonies and festivities, such
as dancing (see Plates <a href="#pl13">XIII</a>, <a href=
"#pl14">XIV</a>), division of food, tribal feasts, mortuary vigils, in
short, of all doings that represent the village as a whole. In the
circular street between the stores and living houses, everyday life
goes on, that is, the preparation of food, the eating of meals, and the
usual exchange of gossip and ordinary social amenities. The interior of
the houses is only used at night, or on wet days, and is more a
sleeping than a living room. The backs of the houses and the contiguous
groves are the scene of the children&rsquo;s play and the women&rsquo;s
occupations. Further away, remote parts of the grove are reserved for
sanitary purposes, each sex having its own retreat.</p>
<p>The <i lang="kij">baku</i> (central place) is the most picturesque
part, and there the somewhat monotonous colour scheme of the brown and
grey is broken by the overhanging foliage of the grove, seen above the
neat fronts and gaudy ornamentation of the yam-houses and by the
decorations worn by the crowd when a dance or ceremony is taking place
(see Plates <a href="#pl13">XIII</a>, <a href="#pl33">XXXIII</a>).
Dancing is done only at one time in the year, in connection with the
harvest festivities, called <i lang="kij">milamala</i>, at which season
also the spirits of the dead return from Tuma, the nether-world,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href="#pb57" name=
"pb57">57</a>]</span>to the villages from which they hail. Sometimes
the dancing season lasts only for a few weeks or even days, sometimes
it is extended into a special dancing period called <i lang=
"kij">usigola</i>. During such a time of festivities, the inhabitants
of a village will dance day after day, for a month or longer, the
period being inaugurated by a feast, punctuated by several more, and
ending in a big culminating performance. At this many villages assist
as spectators, and distributions of food take place. During an <i lang=
"kij">usigola</i>, dancing is done in full dress, that is, with facial
painting, floral decorations, valuable ornaments, and a head-dress of
white cockatoo feathers (see Plates <a href="#pl13">XIII</a>, <a href=
"#pl14">XIV</a>). A <span class="corr" id="xd26e2976" title=
"Source: performmance">performance</span> consists always of a dance
executed in a ring to the accompaniment of singing and drum-beating,
both of which are done by a group of people standing in the middle.
Some dances are done with the carved dancing shield.</p>
<p>Sociologically, the village is an important unit in the Trobriands.
Even the mightiest chief in the Trobriands wields his authority
primarily over his own village and only secondarily over the district.
The village community exploit jointly their garden lands, perform
ceremonies, wage warfare, undertake trading expeditions, and sail in
the same canoe or fleet of canoes as one group.</p>
<p>After the first inspection of the village, we would be naturally
interested to know more of the surrounding country, and would take a
walk through the bush. Here, however, if we hoped for a picturesque and
varied landscape, we should receive a great disappointment. The
extensive, flat island consists only of one fertile plain, with a low
coral ridge running along portions of the coast. It is almost entirely
under intermittent cultivation, and the bush, regularly cleared away
every few years, has no time to grow high. A low, dense jungle grows in
a matted tangle, and practically wherever we move on the island we walk
along between two green walls, presenting no variety, allowing of no
broader view. The monotony is broken only by an occasional clump of old
trees left standing&mdash;usually a tabooed place&mdash;or by one of
the numerous villages which we meet with every mile or two in this
densely populated country. The main element, both of picturesqueness
and ethnographic interest, is afforded by the native gardens. Each year
about one quarter or one fifth of the total area is under actual
cultivation as gardens, and these <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58"
href="#pb58" name="pb58">58</a>]</span>are well tended, and present a
pleasant change from the monotony of the scrub. In its early stages,
the garden site is simply a bare, cleared space, allowing of a Wider
outlook upon the distant coral ridge in the East, and upon the tall
groves, scattered over the horizon, which indicate villages or tabooed
tree clumps. Later on, when the yam-vines, taro, and sugar cane begin
to grow and bud, the bare brown soil is covered with the fresh green of
the tender plants. After some more time still, tall, stout poles are
planted over each yam-plant; the vine climbs round them, grows into a
full, shady garland of foliage, and the whole makes the impression of a
large, exuberant hop-yard.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Half of the natives&rsquo; working life is spent in
the garden, and around it centres perhaps more than half of his
interests and ambitions. And here we must pause and make an attempt to
understand his attitude in this matter, as it is typical of the way in
which he goes about all his work. If we remain under the delusion that
the native is a happy-go-lucky, lazy child of nature, who shuns as far
as possible all labour and effort, waiting till the ripe fruits, so
bountifully supplied by generous tropical Nature, fall into his mouth,
we shall not be able to understand in the least his aims and motives in
carrying out the Kula or any other enterprise. On the contrary, the
truth is that the native can and, under circumstances, does work hard,
and work systematically, with endurance and purpose, nor does he wait
till he is pressed to work by his immediate needs.</p>
<p>In gardening, for instance, the natives produce much more than they
actually require, and in any average year they harvest perhaps twice as
much as they can eat. Nowadays, this surplus is exported by Europeans
to feed plantation hands in other parts of New Guinea; in olden days it
was simply allowed to rot. Again, they produce this surplus in a manner
which entails much more work than is strictly necessary for obtaining
the crops. Much time and labour is given up to &aelig;sthetic purposes,
to making the gardens tidy, clean, cleared of all debris; to building
fine, solid<a id="xd26e2992" name="xd26e2992"></a> fences, to providing
specially strong and big yam-poles. All these things are to some extent
required for the growth of the plant; but there can be no doubt that
the natives push their conscientiousness far <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59" name="pb59">59</a>]</span>beyond
the limit of the purely necessary. The non-utilitarian element in their
garden work is still more clearly perceptible in the various tasks
which they carry out entirely for the sake of ornamentation, in
connection with magical ceremonies, and in obedience to tribal usage.
Thus, after the ground has been scrupulously cleared and is ready for
planting, the natives divide each garden plot into small squares, each
a few yards in length and width, and this is done only in obedience to
usage, in order to make the gardens look neat. No self-respecting man
would dream of omitting to do this. Again, in especially well trimmed
gardens, long horizontal poles are tied to the yam supports in order to
embellish them. Another, and perhaps the most interesting example of
non-utilitarian work is afforded by the big, prismatic erections called
<i lang="kij">kamkokola</i>, which serve ornamental and magical
purposes, but have nothing to do with the growth of plants (comp.
<a href="#pl59">Plate LIX</a>).</p>
<p>Among the forces and beliefs which bear upon and regulate garden
work, perhaps magic is the most important. It is a department of its
own, and the garden magician, next to the chief and the sorcerer, is
the most important personage of the village. The position is
hereditary, and, in each village, a special system of magic is handed
on in the female line from one generation to another. I have called it
a system, because the magician has to perform a series of rites and
spells over the garden, which run parallel with the labour, and which,
in fact, initiate each stage of the work and each new development of
the plant life. Even before any gardening is begun at all, the magician
has to consecrate the site with a big ceremonial performance in which
all the men of the village take part. This ceremony officially opens
the season&rsquo;s gardening, and only after it is performed do the
villagers begin to cut the scrub on their plots. Then, in a series of
rites, the magician inaugurates successively all the various stages
which follow one another&mdash;the burning of the scrub, the clearing,
the planting, the weeding and the harvesting. Also, in another series
of rites and spells, he magically assists the plant in sprouting, in
budding, in bursting into leaf, in climbing, in forming the rich
garlands of foliage, and in producing the edible tubers.</p>
<p>The garden magician, according to native ideas, thus controls both
the work of man and the forces of Nature. He also acts directly as
supervisor of gardening, sees to it that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb60" href="#pb60" name="pb60">60</a>]</span>people do not skimp their
work, or lag behind with it. Thus magic is a systematising, regulating,
and controlling influence in garden work. The magician, in carrying out
the rites, sets the pace, compels people to apply themselves to certain
tasks, and to accomplish them properly and in time. Incidentally, magic
also imposes on the tribe a good deal of extra work, of apparently
unnecessary, hampering taboos and regulations. In the long run,
however, there is no doubt that by its influence in ordering,
systematising and regulating work, magic is economically invaluable for
the natives.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3008src" href="#xd26e3008"
name="xd26e3008src">2</a></p>
<p>Another notion which must be exploded, once and for ever, is that of
the Primitive Economic Man of some current economic text books. This
fanciful, dummy creature, who has been very tenacious of existence in
popular and semi-popular economic literature, and whose shadow haunts
even the minds of competent anthropologists, blighting their outlook
with a preconceived idea, is an imaginary, primitive man, or savage,
prompted in all his actions by a rationalistic conception of
self-interest, and achieving his aims directly and with the minimum of
effort. Even <i>one</i> well established instance should show how
preposterous is this assumption that man, and especially man on a low
level of culture, should be actuated by pure economic motives of
enlightened self-interest. The primitive Trobriander furnishes us with
such an instance, contradicting this fallacious theory. He works
prompted by motives of a highly complex, social and traditional nature,
and towards aims which are certainly not directed towards the
satisfaction of present wants, or to the direct achievement of
utilitarian purposes. Thus, in the first place, as we have seen, work
is not carried out on the principle of the least effort. On the
contrary, much time and energy is spent on wholly unnecessary effort,
that is, from a utilitarian point of view. Again, work and effort,
instead of being merely a means to an end, are, in a way an end in
themselves. A good garden worker in the Trobriands derives a direct
prestige from the amount of labour he can do, and the size of garden he
can till. The title <i lang="kij">tokwaybagula</i>, which means
&ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;efficient gardener,&rdquo; is bestowed
with discrimination, and borne with pride. Several of my friends,
renowned as <i lang="kij">tokwaybagula</i>, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61" name="pb61">61</a>]</span>would
boast to me how long they worked, how much ground they tilled, and
would compare their efforts with those of less efficient men. When the
labour, some of which is done communally, is being actually carried
out, a good deal of competition goes on. Men vie with one another in
their speed, in their thoroughness, and in the weights they can lift,
when bringing big poles to the garden, or in carrying away the
harvested yams.</p>
<p>The most important point about this is, however, that all, or almost
all the fruits of his work, and certainly any surplus which he can
achieve by extra effort, goes not to the man himself, but to his
relatives-in-law. Without entering into details of the system of the
apportionment of the harvest, of which the sociology is rather complex
and would require a preliminary account of the Trobriand kinship system
and kinship ideas, it may be said that about three quarters of a
man&rsquo;s crops go partly as tribute to the chief, partly as his due
to his sister&rsquo;s (or mother&rsquo;s) husband and family.</p>
<p>But although he thus derives practically no personal benefit in the
utilitarian sense from his harvest, the gardener receives much praise
and renown from its size and quality, and that in a direct and
circumstantial manner. For all the crops, after being harvested, are
displayed for some time afterwards in the gardens, piled up in neat,
conical heaps under small shelters made of yam vine. Each man&rsquo;s
harvest is thus exhibited for criticism in his own plot, and parties of
natives walk about from garden to garden, admiring, comparing and
praising the best results. The importance of the food display can be
gauged by the fact that, in olden days, when the chief&rsquo;s power
was much more considerable than now, it was dangerous for a man who was
not either of high rank himself, or working for such a one, to show
crops which might compare too favourably with those of the chief.</p>
<p>In years when the harvest promises to be plentiful, the chief will
proclaim a <i lang="kij">kayasa</i> harvest, that is to say,
ceremonial, competitive display of food, and then the straining for
good results and the interest taken in them are still higher. We shall
meet later on with ceremonial enterprises of the <i lang=
"kij">kayasa</i> type, and find that they play a considerable part in
the Kula. All this shows how entirely the real native of flesh and bone
differs from the shadowy Primitive Economic Man, on whose imaginary
behaviour many of the scholastic deductions of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name="pb62">62</a>]</span>abstract
economics are based.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3041src" href=
"#xd26e3041" name="xd26e3041src">3</a> The Trobriander works in a
roundabout way, to a large extent for the sake of the work itself, and
puts a great deal of &aelig;sthetic polish on the arrangement and
general appearance of his garden. He is not guided primarily by the
desire to satisfy his wants, but by a very complex set of traditional
forces, duties and obligations, beliefs in magic, social ambitions and
vanities. He wants, if he is a <i>man</i>, to achieve social
distinction as a <i>good gardener</i> and a good worker in general.</p>
<p>I have dwelt at this length upon these points concerning the motives
and aims of the Trobrianders in their garden work, because, in the
chapters that follow, we shall be studying economic activities, and the
reader will grasp the attitude of the natives best if he has it
illustrated to him by various examples. All that has been said in this
matter about the Trobrianders applies also to the neighbouring
tribes.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With the help of this new insight gained into the mind
of the native, and into their social scheme of harvest distribution, it
will be easier to describe the nature of the chief&rsquo;s authority.
Chieftainship in the Trobriands is the combination of two institutions:
first, that of headmanship, or village authority; secondly, that of
totemic clanship, that is the division of the community into classes or
castes, each with a certain more or less definite rank.</p>
<p>In every community in the Trobriands, there is one man who wields
the greatest authority, though often this does not amount to very much.
He is, in many cases, nothing more than the <i lang="la">Primus inter
pares</i> in a group of village elders, who deliberate on all important
matters together, and arrive at a decision by common consent. It must
not be forgotten that there is hardly ever much room for doubt or
deliberation, as natives communally, as well as individually, never act
except on traditional and conventional lines. This village headman is,
as a rule, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=
"pb63">63</a>]</span>therefore, not much more than a master of tribal
ceremonies, and the main speaker within and without the tribe, whenever
one is needed.</p>
<p>But the position of headman becomes much more than this, when he is
a person of high rank, which is by no means always the case. In the
Trobriands there exist four totemic clans, and each of these is divided
into a number of smaller sub-clans,&mdash;which could also be called
families or castes, for the members of each claim common descent from
one ancestress, and each of them holds a certain, specified rank. These
sub-clans have also a local character, because the original ancestress
emerged from a hole in the ground, as a rule somewhere in the
neighbourhood of their village community. There is not one sub-clan in
the Trobriands whose members cannot indicate its original locality,
where their group, in the form of the ancestress, first saw the light
of the sun. Coral outcrops, water-holes, small caves or grottoes, are
generally pointed out as the original &ldquo;holes&rdquo; or
&ldquo;houses,&rdquo; as they are called. Often such a hole is
surrounded by one of the tabooed clumps of trees alluded to before.
Many of them are situated in the groves surrounding a village, and a
few near the sea shore. Not one is on the cultivable land.</p>
<p>The highest sub-clan is that of the Tabalu, belonging to the Malasi
totem clan. To this sub-clan belongs the main chief of Kiriwina,
To&rsquo;uluwa, who resides in the village of Omarakana (see <a href=
"#pl02">Plate II</a> and <a href="#pl00">Frontispiece</a>). He is in
the first place the headman of his own village, and in contrast to the
headmen of low rank, he has quite a considerable amount of power. His
high rank inspires everyone about him with the greatest and most
genuine respect and awe, and the remnants of his power are still
surprisingly large, even now, when white authorities, very foolishly
and with fatal results, do their utmost to undermine his prestige and
influence.</p>
<p>Not only does the chief&mdash;by which word I shall designate a
headman of rank&mdash;possess a high degree of authority within his own
village, but his sphere of influence extends far beyond it. A number of
villages are tributary to him, and in several respects subject to his
authority. In case of war, they are his allies, and have to foregather
in his village. When he needs men to perform some task, he can send to
his subject villages, and they will supply him with workers. In all big
festivities <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64" href="#pb64" name=
"pb64">64</a>]</span>the villages of his district will join, and the
chief will act as master of ceremonies. Nevertheless, for all these
services rendered to him he has to pay. He even has to pay for any
tributes received out of his stores of wealth. Wealth, in the
Trobriands, is the outward sign and the substance of power, and the
means also of exercising it. But how does he acquire his wealth? And
here we come to the main duty of the vassal villages to the chief. From
each subject village, he takes a wife, whose family, according to the
Trobriand law, has to supply him with large amounts of crops. This wife
is always the sister or some relation of the headman of the subject
village, and thus practically the whole community has to work for him.
In olden days, the chief of Omarakana had up to as many as forty
consorts, and received perhaps as much as thirty to fifty per cent. of
all the garden produce of Kiriwina. Even now, when his wives number
only sixteen, he has enormous storehouses, and they are full to the
roof with yams every harvest time.</p>
<p>With this supply, he is able to pay for the many services he
requires, to furnish with food the participants in big feasts, in
tribal gatherings or distant expeditions. Part of the food he uses to
acquire objects of native wealth, or to pay for the making of them. In
brief, through his privilege of practising polygamy, the chief is kept
supplied with an abundance of wealth in food stuffs and in valuables,
which he uses to maintain his high position; to organise tribal
festivities and enterprises, and to pay, according to custom, for the
many personal services to which he is entitled.</p>
<p>One point in connection with the chief&rsquo;s authority deserves
special mention. Power implies not only the possibility of rewarding,
but also the means of punishing. This in the Trobriands is as a rule
done indirectly, by means of sorcery. The chief has the best sorcerers
of the district always at his beck and call. Of course he also has to
reward them when they do him a service. If anyone offends him, or
trespasses upon his authority, the chief summons the sorcerer, and
orders that the culprit shall die by black magic. And here the chief is
powerfully helped in achieving his end by the fact that he can do this
openly, so that everybody, and the victim himself knows that a sorcerer
is after him. As the natives are very deeply and genuinely afraid of
sorcery, the feeling of being <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb65" href=
"#pb65" name="pb65">65</a>]</span>hunted, of imagining themselves
doomed, is in itself enough to doom them in reality. Only in extreme
cases, does a chief inflict direct punishment on a culprit. He has one
or two hereditary henchmen, whose duty it is to kill the man who has so
deeply offended him, that actual death is the only sufficient
punishment. As a matter of fact, very few cases of this are on record,
and it is now, of course, entirely in abeyance.</p>
<p>Thus the chief&rsquo;s position can be grasped only through the
realisation of the high importance of wealth, of the necessity of
paying for everything, even for services which are due to him, and
which could not be withheld. Again, this wealth comes to the chief from
his relations-in-law, and it is through his right to practise polygamy
that he actually achieves his position, and exercises his power.</p>
<p>Side by side with this rather complex mechanism of authority, the
prestige of rank, the direct recognition of his personal superiority,
give the chief an immense power, even outside his district. Except for
the few of his own rank, no native in the Trobriands will remain erect
when the great chief of Omarakana approaches, even in these days of
tribal disintegration. Wherever he goes, he is considered as the most
important person, is seated on a high platform, and treated with
consideration. Of course the fact that he is accorded marks of great
deference, and approached in the manner as if he were a supreme despot,
does not mean that perfect good fellowship and sociability do not reign
in his personal relations with his companions and vassals. There is no
difference in interests or outlook between him and his subjects. They
sit together and chat, they exchange village gossip, the only
difference being that the chief is always on his guard, and much more
reticent and diplomatic than the other, though he is no less
interested. The chief, unless he is too old, joins in dances and even
in games, and indeed he takes precedence as a matter of course.</p>
<p>In trying to realise the social conditions among the Trobrianders
and their neighbours, it must not be forgotten that their social
organisation is in certain respects complex and ill-defined. Besides
very definite laws which are strictly obeyed, there exist a number of
quaint usages, of vague graduations in rules, of others where the
exceptions are so many, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb66" href=
"#pb66" name="pb66">66</a>]</span>that they rather obliterate the rule
than confirm it. The narrow social outlook of the native who does not
see beyond his own district, the prevalence of singularities and
exceptional cases is one of the leading characteristics of native
sociology, one which for many reasons has not been sufficiently
recognised. But the main outlines of chieftainship here presented, will
be enough to give a clear idea of it and of some of the flavour of
their institutions, as much, in fact, as is necessary, in order to
understand the chief&rsquo;s r&ocirc;le in the Kula. But it must to a
certain extent be supplemented by the concrete data, bearing upon the
political divisions of the Trobriands.</p>
<p>The most important chief is, as said, the one who resides in
Omarakana and rules Kiriwina, agriculturally the richest and most
important district. His family, or sub-clan, the Tabalu, are
acknowledged to have by far the highest rank in all the Archipelago.
Their fame is spread over the whole Kula district; the entire province
of Kiriwina derives prestige from its chief, and its inhabitants also
keep all his personal taboos, which is a duty but also a distinction.
Next to the high chief, there resides in a village some two miles
distant, a personage who, though in several respects his vassal, is
also his main foe and rival, the headman of Kabwaku, and ruler of the
province of Tilataula. The present holder of this title is an old rogue
named Moliasi. From time to time, in the old days, war used to break
out between the two provinces, each of which could muster some twelve
villages for the fight. These wars were never very bloody or of long
duration, and they were in many ways fought in a competitive, sporting
manner, since, unlike with the Dobuans and Southern Massim, there were
neither head-hunting nor cannibalistic practices among the Boyowans.
Nevertheless, defeat was a serious matter. It meant a temporary
destruction of the loser&rsquo;s villages, and exile for a year or two.
After that, a ceremony of reconciliation took place, and friend and foe
would help to rebuild the villages.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3096src"
href="#xd26e3096" name="xd26e3096src">4</a> The ruler of Tilataula has
an intermediate rank, and outside his district he does not enjoy much
prestige; but within it, he has a considerable amount of power, and a
good <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67" name=
"pb67">67</a>]</span>deal of wealth, in the shape of stored food and
ceremonial articles. All the villages under his rule, have, of course,
their own independent headman, who, being of low rank, have only a
small degree of local authority.</p>
<p>In the West of the big, Northern half of Boyowa (that is of the main
island of the Trobriand Group) are again two districts, in past times
often at war with one another. One of them, Kuboma, subject to the
chief of Gumilababa, of high rank, though inferior to the chief of
Kiriwina, consists of some ten inland villages, and is very important
as a centre of industry. Among these villages are included those of
Yalaka, Buduwaylaka, Kudukwaykela, where the quicklime is prepared for
betel chewing, and also the lime pots made. The highly artistic
designs, burnt in on the lime pots, are the speciality of these
villagers, but unfortunately the industry is fast decaying. The
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3106" title=
"Source: inhabitabts">inhabitants</span> of Luya are renowned for their
basket work, of which the finest specimens are their production. But
the most remarkable of all is the village of Bwoytalu, whose
inhabitants are at the same time the most despised pariahs, the most
dreaded sorcerers, and the most skilful and industrious craftsmen in
the island. They belong to several sub-clans, all originating in the
neighbourhood of the village, near which also, according to tradition,
the original sorcerer came out of the soil in the form of a crab. They
eat the flesh of bush-pigs, and they catch and eat the stingaree, both
objects of strict taboos and of genuine loathing to the other
inhabitants of Northern Boyowa. For this reason they are despised and
regarded as unclean by the others. In olden days they would have to
crouch lower and more abjectly than anyone else. No man or woman would
mate with anyone from Bwoytalu, whether in marriage or in an intrigue.
Yet in wood carving, and especially in the working out of the
wonderful, round dishes, in the manufacture of plaited fibre work, and
in the production of combs, they are far more skilful than anyone else,
and acknowledged to be such; they are the wholesale manufacturers of
these objects for export, and they can produce work not to be rivalled
by any other village.</p>
<p>The five villages lying on the western coast of the northern half,
on the shores of the Lagoon, form the district of Kulumata. They are
all fishing villages, but differ in their methods, and each has its own
fishing grounds and its own methods of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb68" href="#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>exploiting them.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3113src" href="#xd26e3113" name="xd26e3113src">5</a>
The district is much less homogeneous than any of those before
mentioned. It <span class="corr" id="xd26e3119" title=
"Source: posesses">possesses</span> no paramount chief, and even in war
the villagers used not to fight on the same side. But it is impossible
to enter here into all these shades and singularities of political
organisation.</p>
<p>In the southern part of Boyowa, there is first the province of Luba,
occupying the waist of the island, the part where it narrows down to a
long isthmus. This part is ruled by a chief of high rank, who resides
in Olivilevi. He belongs to the same family as the chief of Omarakana,
and this southern dominion is the result of a younger line&rsquo;s
having branched off some three generations ago. This happened after an
unsuccessful war, when the whole tribe of Kiriwina fled south to Luba,
and lived there for two years in a temporary village. The main body
returned afterwards, but a number remained behind with the
chief&rsquo;s brother, and thus the village of Olivilevi was founded.
Wawela, which was formerly a very big village, now consists of hardly
more than twenty huts. The only one on the Eastern shore which lies
right on the sea, it is very picturesquely situated, overlooking a wide
bay with a clean beach. It is of importance as the traditional centre
of astronomical knowledge. From here, for generation after generation
up to the present day, the calendar of the natives has been regulated.
This means that some of the most important dates are fixed, especially
that of the great annual festival, the <i lang="kij">Milamala</i>,
always held at full moon. Again, Wawela is one of the villages where
the second form of sorcery, that of the flying witches, has its main
Trobriand home. In fact, according to native belief, this form of
sorcery has its seat only in the Southern half, and is unknown to the
women in the North, though the Southern witches extend their field of
operations all over Boyowa. Wawela, which lies facing the East, and
which is always in close touch with the villages of Kitava and the rest
of the Marshall Bennetts, shares with these islands the reputation of
harbouring many women who can fly, kill by magic, who also feed on
corpses, and are especially dangerous to seamen in peril.</p>
<p>Further down to the South, on the Western shore of the Lagoon, we
come to the big settlement of Sinaketa, consisting of some six villages
lying within a few hundred yards from one <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb69" href="#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>another, but each having
its own headman and a certain amount of local characteristics. These
villages form, however, one community for purposes of war and of the
Kula. Some of the local headmen of Sinaketa claim the highest rank,
some are commoners; but on the whole, both the principle of rank and
the power of the chief break down more and more as we move South.
Beyond Sinaketa, we meet a few more villages, who practice a local
Kula, and with whom we shall have to deal later on. Sinaketa itself
will loom very largely in the descriptions that follow. The Southern
part of the island is sometimes called Kaybwagina, but it does not
constitute a definite political unit, like the Northern districts.</p>
<p>Finally, south of the main island, divided from it by a narrow
channel, lies the half-moon-shaped island of Vakuta, to which belong
four small villages and one big one. Within recent times, perhaps four
to six generations ago, there came down and settled in this last
mentioned one a branch of the real Tabalu, the chiefly family of
highest rank. But their power here never assumed the proportions even
of the small chiefs of Sinaketa. In Vakuta, the typical
Papuo-Melanesian system of government by tribal elders&mdash;with one
more prominent than the others, but not paramount&mdash;is in full
vigour.</p>
<p>The two big settlements of Sinaketa and Vakuta play a great part in
the Kula, and they also are the only two communities in the whole
Trobriands where the red shell discs are made. This industry, as we
shall see, is closely associated with the Kula. Politically, Sinaketa
and Vakuta are rivals, and in olden days were periodically at war with
one another.</p>
<p>Another district which forms a definite political and cultural unit
is the large island of Kayleula, in the West. The inhabitants are
fishermen, canoe-builders, and traders, and undertake big expeditions
to the western d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux islands, trading for <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3137" title="Source: betel nut">betel-nut</span>, sago,
pottery and turtle shell in exchange for their own industrial
produce.</p>
<p>It has been necessary to give a somewhat detailed description of
chieftainship and political divisions, as a firm grasp of the main,
political institutions is essential to the understanding of the Kula.
All departments of tribal life, religion, magic, economics are
interwoven, but the <i>social organisation</i> of the tribe lies at the
foundation of everything else. Thus it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>essential to bear in mind
that the Trobriands form one cultural unit, speaking the same language,
having the same institutions, obeying the same laws and regulations,
swayed by the same beliefs and conventions. The districts just
enumerated, into which the Trobriands are <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3147" title="Source: subdivided">sub-divided</span>, are distinct
politically and not culturally; that is, each of them comprises the
same kind of natives, only obeying or at least acknowledging their own
chief, having their own interests and pursuits, and in case of war each
fighting their own fight.</p>
<p>Again, within each district, the several village communities have
each a great deal of independence. A village community is represented
by a headman, its members make their gardens in one block and under the
guidance of their own garden magician; they carry on their own feasts
and ceremonial arrangements, mourn their dead in common, and perform,
in remembrance of their departed ones, an endless series of food
distributions. In all big affairs, whether of the district or of the
tribe, members of a village community keep together, and act in one
group.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">VI</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Right across the political and local divisions cut the
totemic clans, each having a series of linked totems, with a bird as
principal one.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3157src" href="#xd26e3157"
name="xd26e3157src">6</a> The members of these four clans are scattered
over the whole tribe of Boyowa, and in each village community, members
of all four are to be found, and even in every house, there are at
least two classes represented, since a husband must be of a different
clan from his wife and children. There is a certain amount of
solidarity within the clan, based on the very vague feeling of communal
affinity to the totem birds and animals, but much more on the many
social duties, such as the performance of certain ceremonies,
especially the mortuary ones, which band the members of a clan
together. But real solidarity obtains only between members of a
sub-clan. A sub-clan is a local division of a clan, whose members claim
common ancestry, and hence real identity of bodily substance, and also
are attached to the locality where their ancestors emerged. It is to
these sub-clans that the idea of a definite <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name="pb71">71</a>]</span>rank
attaches. One of the totemic clans, the Malasi, includes the most
aristocratic sub-clan, the Tabalu, as well as the lowest one, the local
division of the Malasi in Bwoytalu. A chief of the Tabalu feels very
insulted if it is ever hinted that he is akin to one of the
stingaree-eaters of the unclean village, although they are Malasi like
himself. The principle of rank attached to totemic divisions is to be
met only in Trobriand sociology; it is entirely foreign to all the
other Papuo-Melanesian tribes.</p>
<p>As regards kinship, the main thing to be remembered is that the
natives are matrilineal, and that the succession of rank, membership in
all the social groups, and the inheritance of possessions descend in
the maternal line. The mother&rsquo;s brother is considered the real
guardian of a boy, and there is a series of mutual duties and
obligations, which establish a very close and important relation
between the two. The real kinship, the real identity of substance is
considered to exist only between a man and his mother&rsquo;s
relations. In the first rank of these, his brothers and sisters are
specially near to him. For his sister or sisters he has to work as soon
as they are grown up and married. But, in spite of that, a most
rigorous taboo exists between them, beginning quite early in life. No
man would joke and talk freely in the presence of his sister, or even
look at her. The slightest allusion to the sexual affairs, whether
illicit or matrimonial, of a brother or sister in the presence of the
other, is the deadliest insult and mortification. When a man approaches
a group of people where his sister is talking, either she withdraws or
he turns away.</p>
<p>The father&rsquo;s relation to his children is remarkable.
Physiological fatherhood<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3166src" href=
"#xd26e3166" name="xd26e3166src">7</a> is unknown, and no tie of
kinship or relationship is supposed to exist between father and child,
except that between a mother&rsquo;s husband and the wife&rsquo;s
child. Nevertheless, the father is by far the nearest and most
affectionate friend of his children. In ever so many cases, I could
observe that when a child, a young boy or girl, was in trouble or sick;
when there was a question of some one exposing himself to difficulties
or danger for the child&rsquo;s sake, it was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>always
the father who worried, who would undergo all the hardships needed, and
never the maternal uncle. This state of things is quite clearly
recognised, and explicitly put into words by the natives. In matters of
inheritance and handing over of possessions, a man always shows the
tendency to do as much for his children as he is able, considering his
obligations to his sister&rsquo;s family.</p>

</div>
<p>It is difficult, in one phrase or two, to epitomise the distinction
between the two relations, that between a boy and his maternal uncle,
and that between a son and a father. The best way to put it shortly
might be by saying that the maternal uncle&rsquo;s position of close
relation is regarded as right by law and usage, whereas the
father&rsquo;s interest and affection for his children are due to
sentiment, and to the intimate personal relations existing between
them. He has watched the children grow up, he has assisted the mother
in many of the small and tender cares given to an infant, he has
carried the child about, and given it such education as it gets from
watching the elder ones at work, and gradually joining in. In matters
of inheritance, the father gives the children all that he can, and
gives it freely and with pleasure; the maternal uncle gives under the
compulsion of custom what he cannot withhold and keep for his own
children.</p>

<p class="first">A few more words must be said about some of the
magico-religious ideas of the Trobrianders. The main thing that struck
me in connection with their belief in the spirits of the dead, was that
they are almost completely devoid of any fear of ghosts, of any of
these uncanny feelings with which we face the idea of a possible return
of the dead. All the fears and dreads of the natives are reserved for
black magic, flying witches, malevolent disease-bringing beings, but
above all for sorcerers and witches. The spirits migrate immediately
after death to the island of Tuma, lying in the North-West of Boyowa,
and there they exist for another span of time, underground, say some,
on the surface of the earth, though invisible, say others. They return
to visit their own villages once a year, and take part in the big
annual feast, <i lang="kij">milamala</i>, where they receive offerings.
Sometimes, at this season, they show themselves to the living, who are,
however, not alarmed by it, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href=
"#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>and in general the spirits do not
influence human beings very much, for better or worse.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e3198src" href="#xd26e3198" name="xd26e3198src">8</a>
In a number of magical formul&aelig;, there is an invocation of
ancestral spirits, and they receive offerings in several rites. But
there is nothing of the mutual interaction, of the intimate
collaboration between man and spirit which are the essence of religious
cult.</p>
<p>On the other hand, magic, the attempt of man to govern the forces of
nature directly, by means of a special lore, is all-pervading, and
all-important in the Trobriands.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3203src"
href="#xd26e3203" name="xd26e3203src">9</a> Sorcery and garden magic
have already been mentioned. Here it must suffice to add, that
everything that vitally affects the native is accompanied by magic. All
economic activities have their magic; love, welfare of babies, talents
and crafts, beauty and agility&mdash;all can be fostered or frustrated
by magic. In dealing with the Kula&mdash;a pursuit of immense
importance to the natives, and playing on almost all their social
passions and ambitions&mdash;we shall meet with another system of
magic, and we shall have then to go more into detail about the subject
in general.</p>
<p>Disease, health, or death are also the result of magic or
counter-magic. The Trobrianders have a very complex and very definite
set of theoretical views on these matters. Good health is primarily of
course the natural, normal state. Minor ills may be contracted by
exposure, over-eating, over-strain, bad food, or other ordinary causes.
Such ailments never last, and have never any really bad effects, nor
are they of immediate danger. But, if a man sickens for any length of
time, and his strength seems to be really sapped, then the evil forces
are at work. By far the most prevalent form of black magic, is that of
the <i lang="kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i>, that is the black sorcerer, of
whom there are a number in each district. Usually even in each village
there are one or two men more or less dreaded as <i lang=
"kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i>. To be one does not require any special
initiation except the knowledge of the spells. To learn
these&mdash;that is, to learn them in such a manner as to become an
acknowledged <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span><i lang="kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i>&mdash;can only be
done by means of high payment, or in exceptional circumstances. Thus, a
father will often &ldquo;give&rdquo; his sorcery to his son, always,
however, without payment; or a commoner will teach it to a man of rank,
or a man to his sister&rsquo;s son. In these two latter cases a very
high payment would have to be given. It is important as a
characteristic of the kinship conditions of this people, that a man
receives sorcery gratis from his father, who according to the
traditional kinship system is no blood-relation, whereas he has to pay
for it to his maternal uncle, whose natural heir he is.</p>
<p>When a man has acquired the black art, he applies it to a first
victim, and this has always to be some one of his own family. It is a
firm and definite belief among all the natives that if a man&rsquo;s
sorcery has to be any good, it must first be practised on his mother or
sister, or any of his maternal kindred. Such a matricidal act makes him
a genuine <i lang="kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i>. His art then can be
practised on others, and becomes an established source of income.</p>
<p>The beliefs about sorcery are complex; they differ according as to
whether taken from a real sorcerer, or from an outsider; and there are
also evidently strata of belief, due perhaps to local variation,
perhaps to superimposed versions. Here a short summary must
suffice.</p>
<p>When a sorcerer wants to attack someone, the first step is to cast a
light spell over his habitual haunts, a spell which will affect him
with a slight illness and compel him to keep to his bed in his house,
where he will try to cure himself by lying over a small fire and
warming his body. His first ailment, called <i lang=
"kij">kaynagola</i>, comprises pains in the body, such as (speaking
from our point of view) would be brought about by rheumatism, general
cold, influenza, or any incipient disease. When the victim is in bed,
with a fire burning under him, and also, as a rule, one in the middle
of the hut, the <i lang="kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i> stealthily approaches
the house. He is accompanied by a few nightbirds, owls and night-jars,
which keep guard over him, and he is surrounded by a halo of legendary
terrors which make all natives shiver at the idea of meeting a sorcerer
on such a nocturnal visit. He then tries to insert through the thatch
wall a bunch of herbs impregnated with some deadly charm and tied to a
long stick, and these he attempts to thrust into the fire over which
the sick man is lying. If he succeeds, the fumes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name="pb75">75</a>]</span>of the
burnt leaves will be inhaled by the victim, whose name has been uttered
in the charm, and he will be seized by one or other of the deadly
diseases of which the natives have a long list, with a definite
symptomatology, as well as a magical etiology. Thus the preliminary
sorcery was necessary, in order to keep the victim to his house, in
which spot only can the mortal magic be performed.</p>
<p>Of course, the sick man is on the defensive as well. First of all,
his friends and relatives&mdash;this is one of the main duties of the
wife&rsquo;s brothers&mdash;will keep a close watch over him, sitting
with spears round the hut, and at all approaches to it. Often have I
come across such vigils, when walking late at night through some
village. Then, the services of some rival <i lang=
"kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i> are invoked (for the art of killing and curing
is always in the same hand), and he utters counter-spells, so that at
times the efforts of the first sorcerer, even should he succeed in
burning the herbs according to the dreaded <i lang="kij">toginivayu</i>
rite, are fruitless.</p>
<p>Should this be so, he resorts to the final and most fatal rite, that
of the pointing-bone. Uttering powerful spells, the <i lang=
"kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i> and one or two accomplices, boil some coco-nut
oil in a small pot, far away in a dense patch of jungle. Leaves of
herbs are soaked in the oil, and then wrapped round a sharp stingaree
spine, or some similar pointed object, and the final incantation, most
deadly of all, is chanted over it. Then the <i lang=
"kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i> steals towards the village, catches sight of
his victim, and hiding himself behind a shrub or house, points the
magical dagger at him. In fact, he violently and viciously turns it
round in the air, as if to stab the victim, and to twist and wrench the
point in the wound. This, if carried out properly, and not counteracted
by a still more powerful magician, will never fail to kill a man.</p>
<p>I have here summarised the bare outlines of the successive
application of black magic as it is believed by sorcerer and outsider
alike to be done, and to act in producing disease and death. There can
be no doubt that the acts of sorcery are really carried out by those
who believe themselves to possess the black powers. It is equally
certain that the nervous strain of knowing one&rsquo;s life to be
threatened by a <i lang="kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i> is very great, and
probably it is much worse when a man knows that behind the sorcerer
stands the might of the chief, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76"
href="#pb76" name="pb76">76</a>]</span>and this apprehension certainly
contributes powerfully towards the success of black magic. On the other
hand, a chief, if attacked, would have a good guard to protect him, and
the most powerful wizards to back him up, and also the authority to
deal directly with anyone suspected of plotting against him. Thus
sorcery, which is one of the means of carrying on the established
order, is in its turn strengthened by it.</p>
<p>If we remember that, as in all belief in the miraculous and
supernatural, so also here, there is the loophole of counterforces, and
of the sorcery being incorrectly or inefficiently applied, spoilt by
broken taboos, mispronounced spells, or what not; again, that
suggestion strongly influences the victim, and undermines his natural
resistance; further that all disease is invariably traced back to some
sorcerer or other, who, whether it is true or not, often frankly admits
his responsibility in order to enhance his reputation, there is then no
difficulty in understanding why the belief in black magic flourishes,
why no empirical evidence can ever dispel it, and why the sorcerer no
less than the victim, has confidence in his own powers. At least, the
difficulty is the same as in explaining many contemporary examples of
results achieved by miracles and faith healing, such as Christian
Science or Lourdes, or in any cure by prayers and devotion.</p>
<p>Although by far the most important of them all, the <i lang=
"kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i> is only one among the beings who can cause
disease and death. The often-mentioned flying-witches, who come always
from the Southern half of the island, or from the East, from the
islands of Kitava, Iwa, Gava, or Murua, are even more deadly. All very
rapid and violent diseases, more especially such as show no direct,
perceptible symptoms, are attributed to the <i lang=
"kij">mulukwausi</i>, as they are called. Invisible, they fly through
the air, and perch on trees, house-tops, and other high places. From
there, they pounce upon a man or woman and remove and hide &ldquo;the
inside,&rdquo; that is, the lungs, heart and guts, or the brains and
tongue. Such a victim will die within a day or two, unless another
witch, called for the purpose and well paid, goes in search and
restores the missing &ldquo;inside.&rdquo; Of course, sometimes it is
too late to do it, as the meal has been eaten in the meantime! Then the
victim must die.</p>
<p>Another powerful agency of death consists of the <i lang=
"kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i>, non-human though anthropomorphic beings, who
cause all <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name=
"pb77">77</a>]</span>epidemic disease. When, at the end of the rainy
season the new and unripe yams have come in, and dysentery rages,
decimating the villages; or, when in hot and damp years an infectious
disease passes over the district, taking heavy toll, this means that
the <i lang="kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i> have come from the South, and that,
invisible, they march through the villages, rattling their lime gourds,
and with their sword-clubs or sticks hitting their victims, who
immediately sicken and die. The <i lang="kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i> can, at
will, assume the shape of man or reptile. He appears then as a snake,
or crab, or lizard, and you recognise him at once, for he will not run
away from you, and he has as a rule a patch of some gaudy colour on his
skin. It would be a fatal thing to kill such a reptile. On the
contrary, it has to be taken up cautiously and treated as a chief; that
is to say, it is placed on a high platform, and some of the valuable
tokens of wealth&mdash;a polished green stone blade, or a pair of
arm-shells, or a necklace of spondylus shell beads must be put before
it as an offering.</p>
<p>It is very interesting to note that the <i lang=
"kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i> are believed to come from the Northern coast of
Normanby Island, from the district of Du&rsquo;a&rsquo;u, and more
especially from a place called Sewatupa. This is the very place where,
according to Dobuan belief and myth, their sorcery originated. Thus,
what to the local tribes of the originating place is ordinary sorcery,
practised by men, becomes, when looked at from a great distance, and
from an alien tribe, a non-human agency, endowed with such super-normal
powers as changing of shape, invisibility, and a direct, infallible
method of inflicting death.</p>
<p>The <i lang="kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i> have sometimes sexual
intercourse with women; several present cases are on record, and such
women who have a <span class="corr" id="xd26e3298" title=
"Source: familar">familiar</span> <i lang="kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i>
become dangerous witches, though how they practise their witchcraft is
not quite clear to the natives.</p>
<p>A much less dangerous being is the <i lang="kij">tokway</i>, a
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3309" title=
"Source: wood sprite">wood-sprite</span>, living in trees and rocks,
stealing crops from the field and from the yam-houses, and inflicting
slight ailments. Some men in the past have acquired the knowledge of
how to do this from the <i lang="kij">tokway</i>, and have handed it on
to their descendants.</p>
<p>So we see that, except for the very light ailments which pass
quickly and easily, all disease is attributed to sorcery. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>Even
accidents are not believed to happen without cause. That this is the
case also with drowning, we shall learn more in detail, when we have to
follow the Trobrianders in their dangerous sea-trips. Natural death,
caused by old age, is admittedly possible, but when I asked in several
concrete cases, in which age was obviously the cause, why such and such
a man died, I was always told that a <i lang="kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i>
was at the back of it. Only suicide and death in battle have a
different place in the mind of the natives, and this is also confirmed
by the belief that people killed in war, those that commit suicide, and
those who are bewitched to death have, each class, their own way to the
other world.</p>
<p>This sketch of Trobriand tribal life, belief and customs must
suffice, and we shall still have opportunities of enlarging upon these
subjects that most matter to us for the present study.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Two more districts remain to be mentioned, through
which the Kula trade passes on its circuit, before it returns to the
place from where we started. One of them is the Eastern portion of the
Northern Massim, comprising the Marshall Bennett Islands (Kitava, Iwa,
Gawa, Kwayawata), and Woodlark Island (Murua), with the small group of
Nada Islands<span class="corr" id="xd26e3329" title=
"Not in source">.</span> The other district is that of St. Aignan
Island, called by the natives Masima, or Misima, with the smaller
island Panayati.</p>
<p>Looking from the rocky shores of Boyowa, at its narrowest point, we
can see over the white breakers on the fringing reef and over the sea,
here always blue and limpid, the silhouette of a flat-topped, low rock,
almost due East. This is Kitava. To the Trobrianders of the Eastern
districts, this island and those behind it are the promised land of the
Kula, just as Dobu is to the natives of Southern Boyowa. But here,
unlike in the South, they have to deal with tribesmen who speak their
own language, with dialectic differences only, and who have very much
the same institutions and customs. In fact, the nearest island, Kitava,
differs only very little from the Trobriands. Although the more distant
islands, especially Murua, have a slightly different form of totemism,
with hardly any idea of rank attached to the sub-clans, and
consequently no chieftainship in the Trobriand sense, yet their social
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb79" href="#pb79" name=
"pb79">79</a>]</span>organisation is also much the same as in the
Western province.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3336src" href="#xd26e3336"
name="xd26e3336src">10</a> I know the natives only from having seen
them very frequently and in great numbers in the Trobriands, where they
come on Kula expeditions. In Murua, however, I spent a short time doing
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3342" title=
"Source: field work">field-work</span> in the village of Dikoyas. In
appearance, dress, ornaments and manners, the natives are
indistinguishable from the Trobrianders. Their ideas and customs in
matters of sex, marriage, and kinship are, with variations in detail
only, the same as in Boyowa. In beliefs and mythology, they also belong
to the same culture.</p>
<p>To the Trobrianders, the Eastern islands are also the chief home and
stronghold of the dreaded <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> (flying
witches); the land whence love magic came, originating in the island of
Iwa; the distant shores towards which the mythical hero Tudava sailed,
performing many feats, till he finally disappeared, no one knows where.
The most recent version is that he most likely finished his career in
the white man&rsquo;s country. To the Eastern islands, says native
belief, the spirits of the dead, killed by sorcery, go round on a short
visit not stopping there, only floating through the air like clouds,
before they turn round to the North-West to Tuma.</p>
<p>From these islands, many important products come to Boyowa (the
Trobriands), but none half as important as the tough, homogeneous
green-stone, from which all their implements were made in the past, and
of which the ceremonial axes are made up till now. Some of these places
are renowned for their yam gardens, especially Kitava, and it is
recognised that the best carving in black ebony comes from there. The
most important point of difference between the natives of this district
and the Trobrianders, lies in the method of mortuary distributions, to
which subject we shall have to return in a later part of the book, as
it is closely connected with Kula.</p>
<p>From Murua (Woodlark Island) the Kula track curves over to the South
in two different branches, one direct to Tubetube, and the other to
Misima, and thence to Tubetube and Wari. The district of Misima is
almost entirely unknown to me&mdash;I have only spoken once or twice
with natives of this island, and there is not, to my knowledge, any
reliable published <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href="#pb80"
name="pb80">80</a>]</span>information about that district, so we shall
have to pass it over with a very few words. This is, however, not so
alarming, because it is certain, even from the little I know about
them, that the natives do not essentially differ from the other Massim.
They are totemic and matrilineal; there is no chieftainship, and the
form of authority is the same as in the Southern Massim. Their
sorcerers and witches resemble those of the Southern Massim and
Dobuans. In industries, they specialise in canoe-building, and in the
small island of Panayati produce the same type of craft as the natives
of Gawa and Woodlark Island, slightly different only from the Trobriand
canoe. In the island of Misima, a very big supply of areca (betel) nut
is produced, as there is a custom of planting a number of these nuts
after a man&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The small islands of Tubetube and Wari, which form the final link of
the Kula, lie already within the district of the Southern Massim. In
fact, the island of Tubetube is one of the places studied in detail by
Professor Seligman, and its ethnographical description is one of three
parallel monographs which form the division of the Southern Massim in
the treatise so often quoted.</p>
<p>Finally, I want to point out again that the descriptions of the
various Kula districts given in this and in the previous chapter,
though accurate in every detail, are not meant to be an exhaustive
ethnographic sketch of the tribes. They have been given with a few
light touches in order to produce a vivid and so-to-speak personal
impression of the various type of natives, and countries and of
cultures. If I have succeeded in giving a physiognomy to each of the
various tribes, to the Trobrianders, to the Amphlettans, the Dobuans,
and the Southern Massim, and in arousing some interest in them, the
main purpose has been achieved, and the necessary ethnographic
background for the Kula has been supplied.</p>

<p class="first">Having thus described the scene, and the actors, let
us now proceed to the performance. The Kula is a form of exchange, of
extensive, inter-tribal character; it is carried on by communities
inhabiting a wide ring of islands, which form a closed circuit. This
circuit can be seen on <a href="#map5">Map V</a>, where it is
represented by the lines joining a number of islands to the North and
East of the East end of New Guinea. Along this route, articles of two
kinds, and these two kinds only, are constantly travelling in opposite
directions. In the direction of the hands of a clock, moves constantly
one of these kinds&mdash;long necklaces of red shell, called <i lang=
"kij">soulava</i> (Plates <a href="#pl18">XVIII</a> and <a href=
"#pl19">XIX</a>). In the opposite direction moves the other
kind&mdash;bracelets of white shell called <i lang="kij">mwali</i>
(Plates <a href="#pl16">XVI</a> and <a href="#pl17">XVII</a>). Each of
these articles, as it travels in its own direction on the closed
circuit, meets on its way articles of the other class, and is
constantly being exchanged for them. Every movement of the Kula
articles, every detail of the transactions is fixed and regulated by a
set of traditional rules and conventions, and some acts of the Kula are
accompanied by an elaborate magical ritual and public ceremonies.</p>
<p>On every island and in every village, a more or less limited number
of men take part in the Kula&mdash;that is to say, receive the goods,
hold them for a short time, and then pass them on. Therefore every man
who is in the Kula, periodically though not regularly, receives one or
several <i lang="kij">mwali</i> (arm-shells), or a <i lang=
"kij">soulava</i> (necklace of red shell discs), and then has to hand
it on to one of his partners, from whom he receives the opposite
commodity in exchange. Thus no man ever keeps any of the articles for
any length of time in his possession. One transaction does not finish
the Kula relationship, the rule being <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb82" href="#pb82" name="pb82">82</a>]</span>&ldquo;once in the Kula,
always in the Kula,&rdquo; and a partnership between two men is a
permanent and lifelong affair. Again, any given <i lang="kij">mwali</i>
or <i lang="kij">soulava</i> may always be found travelling and
changing hands, and there is no question of its ever settling down, so
that the principle &ldquo;once in the Kula, always in the Kula&rdquo;
applies also to the valuables themselves.</p>

</div>
<p>The ceremonial exchange of the two articles is the main, the
fundamental aspect of the Kula. But associated with it, and done under
its cover, we find a great number of secondary activities and features.
Thus, side by side with the ritual exchange of arm-shells and
necklaces, the natives carry on ordinary trade, bartering from one
island to another a great number of utilities, often unprocurable in
the district to which they are imported, and indispensable there.
Further, there are other activities, preliminary to the Kula, or
associated with it, such as the building of sea-going canoes for the
expeditions, certain big forms of mortuary ceremonies, and preparatory
taboos.</p>
<p>The Kula is thus an extremely big and complex institution, both in
its geographical extent, and in the manifoldness of its component
pursuits. It welds together a <span class="corr" id="xd26e3442" title=
"Source: condiderable">considerable</span> number of tribes, and it
embraces a vast complex of activities, interconnected, and playing into
one another, so as to form one organic whole.</p>
<p>Yet it must be remembered that what appears to us an extensive,
complicated, and yet well ordered institution is the outcome of ever so
many doings and pursuits, carried on by savages, who have no laws or
aims or charters definitely laid down. They have no knowledge of the
<i>total outline</i> of any of their social structure. They know their
own motives, know the purpose of individual actions and the rules which
apply to them, but how, out of these, the whole collective institution
shapes, this is beyond their mental range. Not even the most
intelligent native has any clear idea of the Kula as a big, organised
social construction, still less of its sociological function and
implications. If you were to ask him what the Kula is, he would answer
by giving a few details, most likely by giving his personal experiences
and subjective views on the Kula, but nothing approaching the
definition just given here. Not even a partial coherent account could
be obtained. For the integral picture does not exist in his mind; he is
in it, and cannot see the whole from the outside. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name="pb84">84</a>]</span></p>
<p>The integration of all the details observed, the achievement of a
sociological synthesis of all the various, relevant symptoms, is the
task of the Ethnographer. First of all, he has to find out that certain
activities, which at first sight might appear incoherent and not
correlated, have a meaning. He then has to find out what is constant
and relevant in these activities, and what accidental and inessential,
that is, to find out the laws and rules of all the transactions. Again,
the Ethnographer has to <i>construct</i> the picture of the big
institution, very much as the physicist constructs his theory from the
experimental data, which always have been within reach of everybody,
but which needed a consistent interpretation. I have touched on this
point of method in the Introduction (Divisions <a href="#div0.5">V</a>
and <a href="#div0.6">VI</a>), but I have repeated it here, as it is
necessary to grasp it clearly in order not to lose the right
perspective of conditions as they really exist among the natives.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In giving the above abstract and concise definition, I
had to reverse the order of research, as this is done in ethnographic
field-work, where the most generalised inferences are obtained as the
result of long inquiries and laborious inductions. The general
definition of the Kula will serve as a sort of plan or diagram in our
further concrete and detailed descriptions. And this is the more
necessary as the Kula is concerned with the exchange of wealth and
utilities, and therefore it is an economic institution, and there is no
other aspect of primitive life where our knowledge is more scanty and
our understanding more superficial than in Economics. Hence
misconception is rampant, and it is necessary to clear the ground when
approaching any economic subject.</p>
<p>Thus in the Introduction we called the Kula a &ldquo;form of
trade,&rdquo; and we ranged it alongside other systems of barter. This
is quite correct, if we give the word &ldquo;<i>trade</i>&rdquo; a
sufficiently wide interpretation, and mean by it any exchange of goods.
But the word &ldquo;trade&rdquo; is used in current Ethnography and
economic literature with so many different implications that a whole
lot of misleading, preconceived ideas have to be brushed aside in order
to grasp the facts correctly. Thus the aprioric current notion of
primitive trade would be that of an exchange of indispensable or useful
articles, done without much ceremony <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>or regulation, under
stress of dearth or need, in spasmodic, irregular intervals&mdash;and
this done either by direct barter, everyone looking out sharply not to
be done out of his due, or, if the savages were too timid and
distrustful to face one another, by some customary arrangement,
securing by means of heavy penalties compliance in the obligations
incurred or imposed.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3474src" href=
"#xd26e3474" name="xd26e3474src">1</a> Waiving for the present the
question how far this conception is valid or not in general&mdash;in my
opinion it is quite misleading&mdash;we have to realise clearly that
the Kula contradicts in almost every point the above definition of
&ldquo;savage trade.&rdquo; It shows to us primitive exchange in an
entirely different light.</p>
<p>The Kula is not a surreptitious and precarious form of exchange. It
is, quite on the contrary, rooted in myth, backed by traditional law,
and surrounded with magical rites. All its main transactions are public
and ceremonial, and carried out according to definite rules. It is not
done on the spur of the moment, but happens periodically, at dates
settled in advance, and it is carried on along definite trade routes,
which must lead to fixed trysting places. Sociologically, though
transacted between tribes differing in language, culture, and probably
even in race, it is based on a fixed and permanent status, on a
partnership which binds into couples some thousands of individuals.
This partnership is a lifelong relationship, it implies various mutual
duties and privileges, and constitutes a type of inter-tribal
relationship on an enormous scale. As to the economic mechanism of the
transactions, this is based on a specific form of credit, which implies
a high degree of mutual <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb86" href=
"#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span>trust and commercial honour&mdash;and
this refers also to the subsidiary, minor trade, which accompanies the
Kula proper. Finally, the Kula is not done under stress of any need,
since its main aim is to exchange articles which are of no practical
use.</p>
<p>From the concise definition of Kula given at the beginning of this
chapter, we see that in its final essence, divested of all trappings
and accessories, it is a very simple affair, which at first sight might
even appear tame and unromantic. After all, it only consists of an
exchange, interminably repeated, of two articles intended for
ornamentation, but not even used for that to any extent. Yet this
simple action&mdash;this passing from hand to hand of two meaningless
and quite useless objects&mdash;has somehow succeeded in becoming the
foundation of a big inter-tribal institution, in being associated with
ever so many other activities. Myth, magic and tradition have built up
around it definite ritual and ceremonial forms, have given it a halo of
romance and value in the minds of the natives, have indeed created a
passion in their hearts for this simple exchange.</p>
<p>The definition of the Kula must now be amplified, and we must
describe one after the other its fundamental characteristics and main
rules, so that it may be clearly grasped by what mechanism the mere
exchange of two articles results in an institution so vast, complex,
and deeply rooted.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">First of all, a few words must be said about the two
principal objects of exchange, the arm-shells (<i lang="kij">mwali</i>)
and the necklaces (<i lang="kij">soulava</i>). The arm-shells are
obtained by breaking off the top and the narrow end of a big,
cone-shaped shell (<i lang="la">Conus millepunctatus</i>), and then
polishing up the remaining ring. These bracelets are highly coveted by
all the Papuo-Melanesians of New Guinea, and they spread even into the
pure Papuan district of the Gulf.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3513src"
href="#xd26e3513" name="xd26e3513src">2</a> The manner of wearing the
arm-shells is illustrated by <a href="#pl17">Plate XVII</a>, where the
men have put them on on purpose to be photographed.</p>
<p>The use of the small discs of red spondylus shell, out of which the
<i lang="kij">soulava</i> are made, is also of a very wide diffusion.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name=
"pb87">87</a>]</span>There is a manufacturing centre of them in one of
the villages in Port Moresby, and also in several places in Eastern New
Guinea, notably in Rossell Island, and in the Trobriands. I have said
&ldquo;<i>use</i>&rdquo; on purpose here, because these small beads,
each of them a flat, round disc with a hole in the centre, coloured
anything from muddy brown to carmine red, are employed in various ways
for ornamentation. They are most generally used as part of earrings,
made of rings of turtle shell, which are attached to the ear lobe, and
from which hang a cluster of the shell discs. These earrings are very
much worn, and, especially among the Massim, you see them on the ears
of every second man or woman, while others are satisfied with turtle
shell alone, unornamented with the shell discs. Another everyday
ornament, frequently met with and worn, especially by young girls and
boys, consists of a short necklace, just encircling the neck, made of
the red spondylus discs, with one or more cowrie shell pendants. These
shell discs can be, and often are, used in the make-up of the various
classes of the more elaborate ornaments, worn on festive occasions
only. Here, however, we are more especially concerned with the very
long necklaces, measuring from two to five metres, made of spondylus
discs, of which there are two main varieties, one, much the finer, with
a big shell pendant, the other made of bigger discs, and with a few
cowrie shells or black banana seeds in the centre (see <a href=
"#pl18">Plate XVIII</a>).</p>
<p>The arm-shells on the one hand, and the long spondylus shell strings
on the other, the two main Kula articles, are primarily ornaments. As
such, they are used with the most elaborate dancing dress only, and on
very festive occasions such as big ceremonial dances, great feasts, and
big gatherings, where several villages are represented, as can be seen
in <a href="#pl06">Plate VI</a>. Never could they be used as everyday
ornaments, nor on occasions of minor importance, such as a small dance
in the village, a harvest gathering, a love-making expedition, when
facial painting, floral decoration and smaller though not quite
everyday ornaments are worn (see Plates <a href="#pl12">XII</a> and
<a href="#pl13">XIII</a>). But even though usable and sometimes used,
this is not the main function of these articles. Thus, a chief may have
several shell strings in his possession, and a few arm-shells.
Supposing that a big dance is held in his or in a neighbouring village,
he will not put on his ornaments himself if he goes to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>assist
at it, unless he intends to dance and decorate himself, but any of his
relatives, his children or his friends and even vassals, can have the
use of them for the asking. If you go to a feast or a dance where there
are a number of men wearing such ornaments, and ask anyone of them at
random to whom it belongs, the chances are that more than half of them
will answer that they themselves are not the owners, but that they had
the articles lent to them. These objects are not owned in order to be
used; the privilege of decorating oneself with them is not the real aim
of possession.</p>

<p>This shows the manner in which a soulava is worn, when used as a
decoration. (See <a href="#div3.1">Div. I</a>)</p>
</div>
<p>Indeed&mdash;and this is more significant&mdash;by far the greater
number of the arm-shells, easily ninety per cent., are of too small a
size to be worn even by young boys and girls. A few are so big and
valuable that they would not be worn at all, except once in a decade by
a very important man on a very festive day. Though all the
shell-strings can be worn, some of them are again considered too
valuable, and are cumbersome for frequent use, and would be worn on
very exceptional occasions only.</p>
<p>This negative description leaves us with the questions: why, then,
are these objects valued, what purpose do they serve? The full answer
to this question will emerge out of the whole story contained in the
following chapters, but an approximate idea must be given at once. As
it is always better to approach the unknown through the known, let us
consider for a moment whether among ourselves we have not some type of
objects which play a similar r&ocirc;le and which are used and
possessed in the same manner. When, after a six years&rsquo; absence in
the South Seas and Australia, I returned to Europe and did my first bit
of sight-seeing in Edinburgh Castle, I was shown the Crown jewels. The
keeper told many stories of how they were worn by this or that king or
queen on such and such occasion, of how some of them had been taken
over to London, to the great and just indignation of the whole Scottish
nation, how they were restored, and how now everyone can be pleased,
since they are safe under lock and key, and no one can touch them. As I
was looking at them and thinking how ugly, useless, ungainly, even
tawdry they were, I had the feeling that something similar had been
told to me of late, and that I had seen many other objects of this
sort, which made a similar impression on me. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name="pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>And then arose before me the vision of a native village on coral
soil, <span class="corr" id="xd26e3601" title="Source: ond">and</span>
a small, rickety platform temporarily erected under a pandanus thatch,
surrounded by a number of brown, naked men, and one of them showing me
long, thin red strings, and big, white, worn-out objects, clumsy to
sight and greasy to touch. With reverence he also would name them, and
tell their history, and by whom and when they were worn, and how they
changed hands, and how their temporary possession was a great sign of
the importance and glory of the village. The analogy between the
European and the Trobriand <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> (valuables)
must be delimited with more precision. The Crown jewels, in fact, any
heirlooms too valuable and too cumbersome to be worn, represent the
same type as <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> in that they are merely
possessed for the sake of possession itself, and the ownership of them
with the ensuing renown is the main source of their value. Also both
heirlooms and <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> are cherished because of
the historical sentiment which surrounds them. However ugly, useless,
and&mdash;according to current standards&mdash;valueless an object may
be, if it has figured in historical scenes and passed through the hands
of historic persons, and is therefore an unfailing vehicle of important
sentimental associations, it cannot but be precious to us. This
historic sentimentalism, which indeed has a large share in our general
interest in studies of past events, exists also in the South Seas.
Every really good Kula article has its individual name, round each
there is a sort of history and romance in the traditions of the
natives. Crown jewels or heirlooms are insignia of rank and symbols of
wealth respectively, and in olden days with us, and in New Guinea up
till a few years ago, both rank and wealth went together. The main
point of difference is that the Kula goods are only in possession for a
time, whereas the European treasure must be permanently owned in order
to have full value.</p>
<p>Taking a broader, ethnological view of the question, we may class
the Kula valuables among the many &ldquo;ceremonial&rdquo; objects of
wealth; enormous, carved and decorated weapons, stone implements,
articles of domestic and industrial nature, too well decorated and too
clumsy for use. Such things are usually called
&ldquo;ceremonial,&rdquo; but this word seems to cover a great number
of meanings and much that has no meaning at all. In fact, very often,
especially on museum labels, an article <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb90" href="#pb90" name="pb90">90</a>]</span>is called
&ldquo;ceremonial&rdquo; simply because nothing is known about its uses
and general nature. Speaking only about museum exhibits from New
Guinea, I can say that many so-called ceremonial objects are nothing
but simply overgrown objects of use, which preciousness of material and
amount of labour expended have transformed into reservoirs of condensed
economic value. Again, others are used on festive occasions, but play
no part whatever in rites and ceremonies, and serve for decoration
only, and these might be called <i>objects of parade</i> (comp.
<a href="#div6.1">Chap. VI, Div. I</a>). Finally, a number of these
articles function actually as instruments of a magical or religious
rite, and belong to the intrinsic apparatus of a ceremony. Such and
such only could be correctly called <i>ceremonial</i>. During the
<i lang="kij">So&rsquo;i</i> feasts among the Southern Massim, women
carrying polished axe blades in fine carved handles, accompany with a
<span class="corr" id="xd26e3630" title=
"Source: rythmic">rhythmic</span> step to the beat of drums, the entry
of the pigs and mango saplings into the village (see Plates <a href=
"#pl05">V</a> and <a href="#pl06">VI</a>). As this is part of the
ceremony and the axes are an indispensable accessory, their use in this
case can be legitimately called &ldquo;ceremonial.&rdquo; Again, in
certain magical ceremonies in the Trobriands, the <i lang=
"kij">towosi</i> (garden magician) has to carry a mounted axe blade on
his shoulders, and with it he delivers a ritual blow at a <i lang=
"kij">kamkokola</i> structure (see Plate <a href="#pl59">LIX</a>;
compare <a href="#div2.4">Chapter II, Division IV</a>).</p>
<p>The <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>&mdash;the Kula
valuables&mdash;in one of their aspects are overgrown objects of use.
They are also, however, <i>ceremonial</i> objects in the narrow and
correct sense of the word. This will become clear after perusal of the
following pages, and to this point we shall return in the <a href=
"#ch22">last chapter</a>.</p>
<p>It must be kept in mind that here we are trying to obtain a clear
and vivid idea of what the Kula valuables are to the natives, and not
to give a detailed and circumstantial description of them, nor to
define them with precision. The comparison with the European heirlooms
or Crown jewels was given in order to show that this type of ownership
is not entirely a fantastic South Sea custom, untranslatable into our
ideas. For&mdash;and this is a point I want to stress&mdash;the
comparison I have made is not based on purely external, superficial
similarity. The psychological and sociological forces at work are the
same, it is really the same mental attitude which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name="pb91">91</a>]</span>makes us
value our heirlooms, and makes the natives in New Guinea value their
<i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The exchange of these two classes of <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, of the armshells and the necklaces,
constitutes the main act of the Kula. This exchange is not done freely,
right and left, as opportunity offers, and where the whim leads. It is
subject indeed to strict limitations and regulations. One of these
refers to the sociology of the exchange, and entails that Kula
transactions can be done only between partners. A man who is in the
Kula&mdash;for not everyone within its district is entitled to carry it
on&mdash;has only a limited number of people with whom he does it. This
partnership is entered upon in a definite manner, under fulfilment of
certain formalities, and it constitutes a life-long relationship. The
number of partners a man has varies with his rank and importance. A
commoner in the Trobriands would have a few partners only, whereas a
chief would number hundreds of them. There is no special social
mechanism to limit the partnership of some people and extend that of
the others, but a man would naturally know to what number of partners
he was entitled by his rank and position. And there would be always the
example of his immediate ancestors to guide him. In other tribes, where
the distinction of rank is not so pronounced, an old man of standing,
or a headman of a hamlet or village would also have hundreds of Kula
associates, whereas a man of minor importance would have but few.</p>
<p>Two Kula partners have to <i lang="kij">kula</i> with one another,
and exchange other gifts incidentally; they behave as friends, and have
a number of mutual duties and obligations, which vary with the distance
between their villages and with their reciprocal status. An average man
has a few partners near by, as a rule his relations-in-law or his
friends, and with these partners, he is generally on very friendly
terms. The Kula partnership is one of the special bonds which unite two
men into one of the standing relations of mutual exchange of gifts and
services so characteristic of these natives. Again, the average man
will have one or two chiefs in his or in the neighbouring districts
with whom he <i>kulas</i>. In such a case, he would be bound to assist
and serve them in various ways, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb92"
href="#pb92" name="pb92">92</a>]</span>to offer them the pick of his
<i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> when he gets a fresh supply. On the
other hand he would expect them to be specially liberal to him.</p>
<p>The overseas partner is, on the other hand, a host, patron and ally
in a land of danger and insecurity. Nowadays, though the feeling of
danger still persists, and natives never feel safe and comfortable in a
strange district, this danger is rather felt as a magical one, and it
is more the fear of foreign sorcery that besets them. In olden days,
more tangible dangers were apprehended, and the partner was the main
guarantee of safety. He also provides with food, gives presents, and
his house, though never used to sleep in, is the place in which to
foregather while in the village. Thus the Kula partnership provides
every man within its ring with a few friends near at hand, and with
some friendly allies in the far-away, dangerous, foreign districts.
These are the only people with whom he can <i lang="kij">kula</i>, but,
of course, amongst all his partners, he is free to choose to which one
he will offer which object.</p>
<p>Let us now try to cast a broad glance at the cumulative effects of
the rules of partnership. We see that all around the ring of Kula there
is a network of relationships, and that naturally the whole forms one
interwoven fabric. Men living at hundreds of miles&rsquo; sailing
distance from one another are bound together by direct or intermediate
partnership, exchange with each other, know of each other, and on
certain occasions meet in a large intertribal gathering (<a href=
"#pl20">Plate XX</a>). Objects given by one, in time reach some very
distant indirect partner or other, and not only Kula objects, but
various articles of domestic use and minor gifts. It is easy to see
that in the long run, not only objects of material culture, but also
customs, songs, art motives and general cultural influences travel
along the Kula route. It is a vast, inter-tribal net of relationships,
a big institution, consisting of thousands of men, all bound together
by one common passion for Kula exchange, and secondarily, by many minor
ties and interests.</p>
<p>Returning again to the personal aspect of the Kula, let us take a
concrete example, that of <i>an average man</i> who lives, let us
assume, in the village of Sinaketa, an important Kula centre in the
Southern Trobriands. He has a few partners, near and far, but they
again fall into categories, those who give him arm-shells, and those
who give him necklaces. For it is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93"
href="#pb93" name="pb93">93</a>]</span>naturally an invariable rule of
the Kula that arm-shells and necklaces are never received from the same
man, since they must travel in different directions. If one partner
gives the armshells, and I return to him a necklace, all future
operations have to be of the same type. More than that, the nature of
the operation between me, the man of Sinaketa, and my partner, is
determined by our relative positions with regard to the points of the
compass. Thus I, in Sinaketa, would receive from the North and East
only arm-shells; from the South and West, necklaces are given to me. If
I have a near partner next door to me, if his abode is North or East of
mine, he will always be giving me arm-shells and receiving necklaces
from me. If, at a later time he were to shift his residence within the
village, the old relationship would obtain, but if he became a member
of another village community on the other side of me the relationship
would be reversed. The partners in villages to the North of Sinaketa,
in the district of Luba, Kulumata, or Kiriwina all supply me with
arm-shells. These I hand over to my partners in the South, and receive
from them necklaces. The South in this case means the southern
districts of Boyowa, as well as the Amphletts and Dobu.</p>
<p>Thus every man has to obey definite rules as to the geographical
direction of his transactions. At any point in the Kula ring, if we
imagine him turned towards the centre of the circle, he receives the
arm-shells with his left hand, and the necklaces with his right, and
then hands them both on. In other words, he constantly passes the
arm-shells from left to right, and the necklaces from right to
left.</p>
<p>Applying this rule of personal conduct to the whole Kula ring, we
can see at once what the aggregate result is. The sum total of
exchanges will not result in an aimless shifting of the two classes of
article, in a fortuitous come and go of the armshells and necklaces.
Two continuous streams will constantly flow on, the one of necklaces
following the hands of a clock, and the other, composed of the
arm-shells, in the opposite direction. We see thus that it is quite
correct to speak of the <i>circular</i> exchange of the Kula, of a ring
or circuit of moving articles (comp. <a href="#map5">Map V</a>). On
this ring, all the villages are placed in a definitely fixed position
with regard to one another, so that one is always on either the
arm-shell or on the necklace side of the other. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb94" href="#pb94" name="pb94">94</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now we pass to another rule of the Kula, of the greatest importance.
As just explained &ldquo;the armshells and shell-strings always travel
in their own respective directions on the ring, and they are never,
under any circumstances, traded back in the wrong direction. Also, they
never stop. It seems almost incredible at first, but it is the fact,
nevertheless, that no one ever keeps any of the Kula: valuables for any
length of time. Indeed, in the whole of the Trobriands there are
perhaps only one or two specially fine armshells and shell-necklaces
permanently owned as heirlooms, and these are set apart as a special
class, and are once and for all out of the Kula.
&lsquo;Ownership,&rsquo; therefore, in Kula, is quite a special
economic relation. A man who is in the Kula never keeps any article for
longer than, say, a year or two. Even this exposes him to the reproach
of being niggardly, and certain districts have the bad reputation of
being &lsquo;slow&rsquo; and &lsquo;hard&rsquo; in the Kula. On the
other hand, each man has an enormous number of articles passing through
his hands during his life time, of which he enjoys a temporary
possession, and which he keeps in trust for a time. This possession
hardly ever makes him use the articles, and he remains under the
obligation soon again to hand them on to one of his partners. But the
temporary ownership allows him to draw a great deal of renown, to
exhibit his article, to tell how he obtained it, and to plan to whom he
is going to give it. And all this forms one of the favourite subjects
of tribal conversation and gossip, in which the feats and the glory in
Kula of chiefs or commoners are constantly discussed and
re-discussed.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3722src" href=
"#xd26e3722" name="xd26e3722src">3</a> Thus every article moves in one
direction only, never comes back, never permanently stops, and takes as
a rule some two to ten years to make the round.</p>
<p>This feature of the Kula is perhaps its most remarkable one, since
it creates a new type of ownership, and places the two Kula articles in
a class of their own. Here we can return to the comparison drawn
between the <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> (Kiriwinian valuables) and
the European heirlooms. This comparison broke down on one point: in the
European objects of this class, permanent ownership, lasting
association with the hereditary dignity or rank or with a family, is
one of its main features. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href=
"#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>In this the Kula articles differ from
heirlooms, but resemble another type of valued object, that is,
trophies, gauges of superiority, sporting cups, objects which are kept
for a time only by the winning party, whether a group or an individual.
Though held only in trust, only for a period, though never used in any
utilitarian way, yet the holders get from them a special type of
pleasure by the mere fact of owning them, of being entitled to them.
Here again, it is not only a superficial, external resemblance, but
very much the same mental attitude, favoured by similar social
arrangements. The resemblance goes so far that in the Kula there exists
also the element of pride in merit, an element which forms the main
ingredient in the pleasure felt by a man or group holding a trophy.
Success in Kula is ascribed to special, personal power, due mainly to
magic, and men are very proud of it. Again, the whole community glories
in a specially fine Kula trophy, obtained by one of its members.</p>
<p>All the rules so far enumerated&mdash;looking at them from the
individual point of view&mdash;limit the social range and the direction
of the transactions as well as the duration of ownership of the
articles. Looking at them from the point of view of their integral
effect, they shape the general outline of the Kula, give it the
character of the double-closed circuit. Now a few words must be said
about the nature of each individual transaction, in so far as its
<i>commercial technicalities</i> are concerned. Here very definite
rules also obtain.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The main principle underlying the regulations of
actual exchange is that the Kula consists in the bestowing of a
ceremonial gift, which has to be repaid by an equivalent counter-gift
after a lapse of time, be it a few hours or even minutes, though
sometimes as much as a year or more may elapse between
payments.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3745src" href="#xd26e3745" name=
"xd26e3745src">4</a> But it can never be exchanged from hand to hand,
with the equivalence between the two objects discussed, bargained about
and computed. The decorum of the Kula transaction is strictly kept, and
highly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href="#pb96" name=
"pb96">96</a>]</span>valued. The natives sharply distinguish it from
barter, which they practise extensively, of which they have a clear
idea, and for which they have a settled term&mdash;in Kiriwinian:
<i lang="kij">gimwali</i>. Often, when criticising an incorrect, too
hasty, or indecorous procedure of Kula, they will say: &ldquo;He
conducts his Kula as if it were <i lang="kij">gimwali</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second very important principle is that the equivalence of the
counter-gift is left to the giver, and it cannot be enforced by any
kind of coercion. A partner who has received a Kula gift is expected to
give back fair and full value, that is, to give as good an arm-shell as
the necklace he receives, or vice versa. Again, a very fine article
must be replaced by one of equivalent value, and not by several minor
ones, though intermediate gifts may be given to mark time before the
real repayment takes place.</p>
<p>If the article given as counter-gift is not equivalent, the
recipient will be disappointed and angry, but he has no direct means of
redress, no means of coercing his partner, or of putting an end to the
whole transaction. What then are the forces at work which keep the
partners to the terms of the bargain? Here we come up against a very
important feature of the native&rsquo;s mental attitude towards wealth
and value. The great misconception of attributing to the savage a pure
economic nature, might lead us to reason incorrectly thus: &ldquo;The
passion of acquiring, the loathing to lose or give away, is the
fundamental and most primitive element in man&rsquo;s attitude to
wealth. In primitive man, this primitive characteristic will appear in
its simplest and purest form. <i>Grab and never let go</i> will be the
guiding principle of his life.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e3763src" href="#xd26e3763" name="xd26e3763src">5</a> The
fundamental error in this reasoning is that it assumes that
&ldquo;primitive man,&rdquo; as represented by the present-day savage,
lives, at least in economic matters, untrammelled by conventions and
social restrictions. Quite the reverse is the case<span class="corr"
id="xd26e3766" title="Not in source">.</span> Although, like every
human being, the Kula native loves to possess and therefore desires to
acquire and dreads to lose, the social code of rules, with regard to
give and take by far overrides his natural acquisitive tendency.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span></p>
<p>This social code, such as we find it among the natives of the Kula
is, however, far from weakening the natural desirability of possession;
on the contrary, it lays down that to possess is to be great, and that
wealth is the indispensable appanage of social rank and attribute of
personal virtue. But the important point is that with them to possess
is to give&mdash;and here the natives differ from us notably. A man who
owns a thing is naturally expected to share it, to distribute it, to be
its trustee and dispenser. And the higher the rank the greater the
obligation. A chief will naturally be expected to give food to any
stranger, visitor, even loiterer from another end of the village. He
will be expected to share any of the betel-nut or tobacco he has about
him. So that a man of rank will have to hide away any surplus of these
articles which he wants to preserve for his further use. In the Eastern
end of New Guinea a type of large basket, with three layers,
manufactured in the Trobriands, was specially popular among people of
consequence, because one could hide away one&rsquo;s small treasures in
the lower compartments. Thus the main symptom of being powerful is to
be wealthy, and of wealth is to be generous. Meanness, indeed, is the
most despised vice, and the only thing about which the natives have
strong moral views, while generosity is the essence of goodness.</p>
<p>This moral injunction and ensuing habit of generosity, superficially
observed and misinterpreted, is responsible for another wide-spread
misconception, that of the <i>Primitive communism of savages</i>. This,
quite as much as the diametrically opposed figment of the acquisitive
and ruthlessly tenacious native, is definitely erroneous, and this will
be seen with sufficient clearness in the following chapters.</p>
<p>Thus the fundamental principle of the natives&rsquo; moral code in
this matter makes a man do his fair share in Kula transaction and the
more important he is, the more will he desire to shine by his
generosity. <i lang="fr">Noblesse oblige</i> is in reality the social
norm regulating their conduct<span class="corr" id="xd26e3782" title=
"Not in source">.</span> This does not mean that people are always
satisfied, and that there are no squabbles about the transactions, no
resentments and even feuds. It is obvious that, however much a man may
want to give a good equivalent for the object received, he may not be
able to do so. And then, as there is always a keen competition to be
the most generous giver, a man who has received less than he gave will
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href="#pb98" name=
"pb98">98</a>]</span>not keep his grievance to himself, but will brag
about his own generosity and compare it to his partner&rsquo;s
meanness; the other resents it, and the quarrel is ready to break out.
But it is very important to realise that there is no actual haggling,
no tendency to do a man out of his share. The giver is quite as keen as
the receiver that the gift should be generous, though for different
reasons. Then, of course, there is the important consideration that a
man who is fair and generous in the Kula will attract a larger stream
to himself than a mean one.</p>
<p>The two main principles, namely, first that the Kula is a gift
repaid after an interval of time by a counter-gift, and not a
bartering; and second, that the equivalent rests with the giver, and
cannot be enforced, nor can there be any haggling or going back on the
exchange&mdash;these underlie all the transactions. A concrete outline
of how they are carried on, will give a sufficient preliminary
idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us suppose that I, a Sinaketa man, am in possession of a
pair of big armshells. An overseas expedition from Dobu in the
d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux Archipelago, arrives at my village. Blowing a
conch shell, I take my armshell pair and I offer it to my overseas
partner, with some such words as &lsquo;This is a <i lang=
"kij">vaga</i> (opening gift)&mdash;in due time, thou returnest to me a
big <i lang="kij">soulava</i> (necklace) for it!&rsquo; Next year, when
I visit my partner&rsquo;s village, he either is in possession of an
equivalent necklace, and this he gives to me as <i lang=
"kij">yotile</i> (return gift), or he has not a necklace good enough to
repay my last gift. In this case he will give me a small
necklace&mdash;avowedly not equivalent to my gift&mdash;and he will
give it to me as <i lang="kij">basi</i> (intermediary gift). This means
that the main gift has to be repaid on a future occasion, and the
<i lang="kij">basi</i> is given in token of good faith&mdash;but it, in
turn, must be repaid by me in the meantime by a gift of small
arm-shells. The final gift, which will be given to me to clinch the
whole transaction, would then be called <i lang="kij">kudu</i>
(clinching gift) in contrast to <i lang="kij">basi</i>&rdquo; (loc.
cit., p. 99).</p>

<p class="figureHead">A Kula Gathering on the Beach of Sinaketa</p>
<p>Along about half a mile&rsquo;s length of shore, over eighty canoes
are beached or moored, and in the village, on the beach, and in the
surrounding country there are assembled some two thousand natives from
several districts, ranging from Kitava to Dobu. This illustrates the
manner in which the Kula brings together large numbers of people
belonging to different cultures; in this case, that of Kitava, Boyowa,
the Amphletts and Dobu. (See <a href="#div3.4">Div. IV</a>, and
<a href="#div16.2">Ch. XVI, Div. II.</a>)</p>
</div>
<p>Although haggling and bargaining are completely ruled out of the
Kula, there are customary and regulated ways of bidding for a piece of
<i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> known to be in the possession of
one&rsquo;s partner. This is done by the offer of what we shall call
solicitary gifts, of which there are several types. &ldquo;If I, an
inhabitant of Sinaketa, happen to be in possession of a pair of
arm-shells more than usually good, the fame of it spreads, for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>it must be remembered that each one of the
first-class armshells and necklaces has a personal name and a history
of its own, and as they circulate around the big ring of the Kula, they
are all well known, and their appearance in a given district always
creates a sensation. Now, all my partners&mdash;whether from overseas
or from within the district&mdash;compete for the favour of receiving
this particular article of mine, and those who are specially keen try
to obtain it by giving me <i lang="kij">pokala</i> (offerings) and
<i lang="kij">kaributu</i> (solicitary gifts). The former (<i lang=
"kij">pokala</i>) consist as a rule of pigs, especially fine bananas,
and yams or taro; the latter (<i lang="kij">kaributu</i>) are of
greater value: the valuable, large axe-blades (called <i lang=
"kij">beku</i>), or lime spoons of whale bone are given&rdquo; (<i>loc.
cit<span class="corr" id="xd26e3853" title=

repayment of these solicitary gifts and a few more technicalities and
technical expressions connected herewith will be given later on in

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I have enumerated the main rules of the Kula in a
manner sufficient for a preliminary definition, and now a few words
must be said about the associated activities and secondary aspects of
the Kula. If we realise that at times the exchange has to take place
between districts divided by dangerous seas, over which a great number
of people have to travel by sail, and do so keeping to appointed dates,
it becomes clear at once that considerable preparations are necessary
to carry out the expedition. Many preliminary activities are intimately
associated with the Kula. Such are, particularly, the building of
canoes, preparation of the outfit, the provisioning of the expedition,
the fixing of dates and social organisation of the enterprise. All
these are subsidiary to the Kula, and as they are carried on in pursuit
of it, and form one connected series, a description of the Kula must
embrace an account of these preliminary activities. The detailed
account of canoe building, of the ceremonial attached to it, of the
incidental magical rites, of the launching and trial run, of the
associated customs which aim at preparing the outfit&mdash;all this
will be described in detail in the next few chapters.</p>
<p>Another important pursuit inextricably bound up with the Kula, is
that of the <i>secondary trade</i>. Voyaging to far-off countries,
endowed with natural resources unknown in their <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name="pb100">100</a>]</span>own
homes, the Kula sailors return each time richly laden with these, the
spoils of their enterprise. Again, in order to be able to offer
presents to his partner, every outward bound canoe carries a cargo of
such things as are known to be most desirable in the overseas district.
Some of this is given away in presents to the partners, but a good deal
is carried in order to pay for the objects desired at home. In certain
cases, the visiting natives exploit on their own account during the
journey some of the natural resources overseas. For example, the
Sinaketans dive for the spondylus in Sanaroa Lagoon, and the Dobuans
fish in the Trobriands on a beach on the southern end of the island.
The secondary trade is complicated still more by the fact that such big
Kula centres as, for instance, Sinaketa, are not efficient in any of
the industries of special value to the Dobuans. Thus, Sinaketans have
to procure the necessary store of goods from the inland villages of
Kuboma, and this they do on minor trading expeditions preliminary to
the Kula. Like the canoe-building, the secondary trading will be
described in detail later on, and has only to be mentioned here.</p>
<p>Here, however, these subsidiary and associated activities must be
put in proper relation with regard to one another and to the main
transaction. Both the canoe-building and the ordinary trade have been
spoken of as secondary or subsidiary to the Kula proper. This requires
a comment. I do not, by thus subordinating the two things in importance
to the Kula, mean to express a philosophical reflection or a personal
opinion as to the relative value of these pursuits from the point of
view of some social teleology. Indeed, it is clear that if we look at
the acts from the outside, as comparative sociologists, and gauge their
real utility, trade and canoe-building will appear to us as the really
important achievements, whereas we shall regard the Kula only as an
indirect stimulus, impelling the natives to sail and to trade. Here,
however, I am not dealing in sociological, but in pure ethnographical
description, and any sociological analysis I have given is only what
has been absolutely indispensable to clear away misconceptions and to
define terms.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3873src" href="#xd26e3873"
name="xd26e3873src">6</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href=
"#pb101" name="pb101">101</a>]</span></p>
<p>By ranging the Kula as the primary and chief activity, and the rest
as secondary ones, I mean that this precedence is implied in the
institutions themselves. By studying the behaviour of the natives and
all the customs in question, we see that the Kula is in all respects
the main aim: the dates are fixed, the preliminaries settled, the
expeditions arranged, the social organisation determined, not with
regard to trade, but with regard to Kula. On an expedition, the big
ceremonial feast, held at the start, refers to the Kula; the final
ceremony of reckoning and counting the spoil refers to Kula, not to the
objects of trade obtained. Finally, the magic, which is one of the main
factors of all the procedure, refers only to the Kula, and this applies
even to a part of the magic carried out over the canoe. Some rites in
the whole cycle are done for the sake of the canoe itself, and others
for the sake of Kula. The construction of the canoes is always carried
on directly in connection with a Kula expedition. All this, of course,
will become really clear and convincing only after the detailed account
is given. But it was necessary at this point to set the right
perspective in the relation between the main Kula and the trade.</p>
<p>Of course not only many of the surrounding tribes who know nothing
of the Kula do build canoes and sail far and daringly on trading
expeditions, but even within the Kula ring, in the Trobriands for
instance, there are several villages who do not kula, yet have canoes
and carry on energetic overseas trade. But where the Kula is practised,
it governs all the other allied activities, and canoe building and
trade are made subsidiary to it. And this is expressed both by the
nature of the institutions and the working of all the arrangements on
the one hand, and by the behaviour and explicit statements of the
natives on the other.</p>
<p>The Kula&mdash;it becomes, I hope, more and more clear&mdash;is a
big, complicated institution, insignificant though its nucleus might
appear. To the natives, it represents one of the most vital interests
in life, and as such it has a ceremonial character and is surrounded by
magic. We can well imagine that articles of wealth might pass from hand
to hand without ceremony or ritual, but in the Kula they never do. Even
when at times only small parties in one or two canoes sail overseas and
bring back <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, certain taboos are
observed, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102" href="#pb102" name=
"pb102">102</a>]</span>and a customary course is taken in departing, in
sailing, and in arriving; even the smallest expedition in one canoe is
a tribal event of some importance, known and spoken of over the whole
district. But the characteristic expedition is one in which a
considerable number of canoes take part, organised in a certain manner,
and forming one body. Feasts, distributions of food, and other public
ceremonies are held, there is one leader and master of the expedition,
and various rules are adhered to, in addition to the ordinary Kula
taboos and observances.</p>
<p>The ceremonial nature of the Kula is strictly bound up with another
of its aspects&mdash;magic. &ldquo;The belief in the efficiency of
magic dominates the Kula, as it does ever so many other tribal
activities of the natives. Magical rites must be performed over the
sea-going canoe when it is built, in order to make it swift, steady and
safe; also magic is done over a canoe to make it lucky in the Kula.
Another system of magical rites is done in order to avert the dangers
of sailing. The third system of magic connected with overseas
expeditions is the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> or the Kula magic proper.
This system consists in numerous rites and spells, all of which act
directly on the mind (<i lang="kij">nanola</i>) of one&rsquo;s partner,
and make him soft, unsteady in mind, and eager to give Kula
gifts&rdquo; (loc. cit., p. 100).</p>
<p>It is clear that an institution so closely associated with magical
and ceremonial elements, as is the Kula, not only rests on a firm,
traditional foundation, but also has its large store of legends.
&ldquo;There is a rich mythology of the Kula, in which stories are told
about far-off times when mythical ancestors sailed on distant and
daring expeditions. Owing totheir magical knowledge they were able to
escape dangers, to conquer their enemies, to surmount obstacles, and by
their feats they established many a precedent which is now closely
followed by tribal custom. But their importance for their descendants
lies mainly in the fact that they handed on their magic, and this made
the Kula possible for the following generations&rdquo; (loc. cit., p.
100).</p>
<p>The Kula is also associated in certain districts, to which the
Trobriands do not belong, with the mortuary feasts, called <i lang=
"kij">so&rsquo;i</i>. The association is interesting and important, and
in <a href="#ch20">Chapter XX</a> an account of it will be given.</p>
<p>The big Kula expeditions are carried on by a great number of
natives, a whole district together. But the geographical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href="#pb103" name=
"pb103">103</a>]</span>limits, from which the members of an expedition
are recruited, are well defined. Glancing at <a href="#map5">Map V</a>,
&ldquo;we see a number of circles, each of which represents a certain
sociological unit which we shall call a Kula community. A Kula
community consists of a village or a number of villages, who go out
together on big overseas expeditions, and who act as a body in the Kula
transactions, perform their magic in common, have common leaders, and
have the same outer and inner social sphere, within which they exchange
their valuables. The Kula consists, therefore, first of the small,
internal transactions within a Kula community or contiguous
communities, and secondly, of the big over-seas expeditions in which
the exchange of articles takes place between two communities divided by
sea. In the first, there is a chronic, permanent trickling of articles
from one village to another, and even within the village. In the
second, a whole lot of valuables, amounting to over a thousand articles
at a time, are exchanged in one enormous transaction, or, more
correctly, in ever so many transactions taking place
simultaneously&rdquo; (loc. cit., p. 101). &ldquo;The Kula trade
consists of a series of such periodical overseas expeditions, which
link together the various island groups, and annually bring over big
quantities of <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> and of subsidiary trade
from one district to another. The trade is used and used up, but the
<i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>&mdash;the armshells and
necklets&mdash;go round and round the ring&rdquo; (loc. cit., p.
105).</p>
<p>In this chapter, a short, summary definition of the Kula has been
given. I enumerated one after the other its most salient features, the
most remarkable rules as they are laid down in native custom, belief
and behaviour. This was necessary in order to give a general idea of
the institution before describing its working in detail. But no
abridged definition can give to the reader the full understanding of a
human social institution. It is necessary for this, to explain its
working concretely, to bring the reader into contact with the people,
show how they proceed at each successive stage, and to describe all the
actual manifestations of the general rules laid down in abstract.</p>
<p>As has been said above, the Kula exchange is carried on by
enterprises of two sorts; first there are the big overseas expeditions,
in which a more or less considerable amount of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href="#pb104" name=
"pb104">104</a>]</span>valuables are carried at one time. Then there is
the inland trade in which the articles are passed from hand to hand,
often changing several owners before they move a few miles.</p>
<p>The big overseas expeditions are by far the more spectacular part of
the Kula. They also contain much more public ceremonial, magical
ritual, and customary usage. They require also, of course, more of
preparation and preliminary activity. I shall therefore have a good
deal more to say about the overseas Kula expeditions than about the
internal exchange.</p>
<p>As the Kula customs and beliefs have been mainly studied in Boyowa,
that is, the Trobriand Islands, and from the Boyowan point of view, I
shall describe, in the first place, the typical course of an overseas
expedition, as it is prepared, organised, and carried out from the
Trobriands. Beginning with the construction of the canoes, proceeding
to the ceremonial launching and the visits of formal presentation of
canoes, we shall choose then the community of Sinaketa, and follow the
natives on one of their overseas trips, describing it in all details.
This will serve us as a type of a Kula expedition to distant lands. It
will then be indicated in what particulars such expeditions may differ
in other branches of the Kula, and for this purpose I shall describe an
expedition from Dobu, and one between Kiriwina and Kitava. An account
of inland Kula in the Trobriands, of some associated forms of trading
and of Kula in the remaining branches will complete the account.</p>
<p>In the <a href="#ch4">next chapter</a> I pass, therefore, to the
preliminary stages of the Kula, in the Trobriands, beginning with a
description of the canoes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb105" href=

<p class="first">A canoe is an item of material culture, and as such it
can be described, photographed and even bodily transported into a
museum. But&mdash;and this is a truth too often overlooked&mdash;the
ethnographic reality of the canoe would not be brought much nearer to a
student at home, even by placing a perfect specimen right before
him.</p>
<p>The canoe is made for a certain use, and with a definite purpose; it
is a means to an end, and we, who study native life, must not reverse
this relation, and make a fetish of the object itself. In the study of
the economic purposes for which a canoe is made, of the various uses to
which it is submitted, we find the first approach to a deeper
ethnographic treatment. Further sociological data, referring to its
ownership, accounts of who sails in it, and how it is done; information
regarding the ceremonies and customs of its construction, a sort of
typical life history of a native craft&mdash;all that brings us nearer
still to the understanding of what his canoe truly means to the
native.</p>
<p>Even this, however, does not touch the most vital reality of a
native canoe. For a craft, whether of bark or wood, iron or steel,
lives in the life of its sailors, and it is more to a sailor than a
mere bit of shaped matter. To the native, not less than to the white
seaman, a craft is surrounded by an atmosphere of romance, built up of
tradition and of personal experience. It is an object of cult and
admiration, a living thing, possessing its own individuality.</p>
<p>We Europeans&mdash;whether we know native craft by experience or
through descriptions&mdash;accustomed to our extraordinarily developed
means of water transport, are apt to look down on a native canoe and
see it in a false perspective&mdash;regarding it almost as a
child&rsquo;s plaything, an abortive, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb106" href="#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>imperfect attempt to
tackle the problem of sailing, which we ourselves have satisfactorily
solved.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e3954src" href="#xd26e3954" name=
"xd26e3954src">1</a> But to the native his cumbersome, sprawling canoe
is a marvellous, almost miraculous achievement, and a thing of beauty
(see Plates <a href="#pl21">XXI</a>, <a href="#pl23">XXIII</a>,
<a href="#pl40">XL</a>, <a href="#pl47">XLVII</a>, <a href=
"#pl55">LV</a>). He has spun a tradition around it, and he adorns it
with his best carvings, he colours and decorates it. It is to him a
powerful contrivance for the mastery of Nature, which allows him to
cross perilous seas to distant places. It is associated with journeys
by sail, full of threatening dangers, of living hopes and desires to
which he gives expression in song and story. In short, in the tradition
of the natives, in their customs, in their behaviour, and in their
direct statements, there can be found the deep love, the admiration,
the specific attachment as to something alive and personal, so
characteristic of the sailors&rsquo; attitude towards his craft.</p>
<p>And it is in this emotional attitude of the natives towards their
canoes that I see the deepest ethnographic reality, which must guide us
right through the study of other aspects&mdash;the customs and
technicalities of construction and of use; the economic conditions and
the associated beliefs and traditions. Ethnology or Anthropology, the
science of Man, must not shun him in his innermost self, in his
instinctive and emotional life.</p>

<p class="figureHead">Canoe Under Sail</p>
<p>This illustrates the rigging, the tilt of the canoe&mdash;the raised
outrigger&mdash;and the carrying capacity of a canoe. This one is well
in the water, with a crew of eighteen men. (See <a href="#div4.1">Div.
I</a> and <a href="#div4.2">II</a>, and <a href="#ch9">Ch. IX</a>).</p>
</div>
<p>A look at the pictures (for instance Plates <a href="#pl21">XXI</a>,
<a href="#pl24">XXIV</a>, <a href="#pl39">XXXIX</a>, or <a href=
"#pl47">XLVII</a>) will give us some idea of the general structure of
the native canoes: the body is a long, deep well, connected with an
outrigger float, which stretches parallel with the body for almost all
its length (see Plates <a href="#pl21">XXI</a> and <a href=
"#pl23">XXIII</a>), and with a platform going across from one side to
the other. The lightness of the material permits it to be much more
deeply immersed than any sea-going European craft, and gives it greater
buoyancy. It skims the surface, gliding up and down the waves, now
hidden by the crests, now riding on top of them. It is a precarious but
delightful sensation to sit in the slender body, while the canoe darts
on with the float raised, the platform steeply slanting, and water
constantly breaking over; or else, still better, to perch on the
platform or on the float&mdash;the latter only feasible in the bigger
canoes&mdash;and be carried across on the sea on a sort of suspended
raft, gliding over the waves in a manner almost uncanny. Occasionally a
wave leaps up and above the platform, and the canoe&mdash;unwieldy,
square raft as it seems at first&mdash;heaves lengthways and crossways,
mounting the furrows with graceful agility. When the sail is hoisted,
its heavy, stiff folds of golden matting unroll with a characteristic
swishing and crackling noise, and the canoe begins to make way; when
the water rushes away below with a hiss, and the yellow sail glows
against the intense blue of sea and sky&mdash;then indeed the romance
of sailing seems to open through a new vista.</p>
<p>The natural reflection on this description is that it presents the
feelings of the Ethnographer, not those of the native. Indeed there is
a great difficulty in disentangling our own sensations from a correct
reading of the innermost native mind. But if an investigator, speaking
the native&rsquo;s language and living among them for some time, were
to try to share and understand their feelings, he will find that he can
gauge them correctly. Soon he will learn to distinguish when the
native&rsquo;s behaviour is in harmony with his own, and when, as it
sometimes happens, the two are at variance.</p>
<p>Thus, in this case, there is no mistaking the natives&rsquo; great
admiration of a good canoe; of their quickness in appreciating
differences in speed, buoyancy and stability, and of their emotional
reaction to such difference. When, on a calm day, suddenly a fresh
breeze rises, the sail is set, and fills, and the canoe lifts its
<i lang="kij">lamina</i> (outrigger float) out of the water, and races
along, flinging the spray to right and left&mdash;there is no mistaking
the keen enjoyment of the natives. All rush to their posts and keenly
watch the movements of the boat; some break out into song, and the
younger men lean over and play with the water. They are never tired of
discussing the good points of their canoes, and analysing the various
craft. In the coastal villages of the Lagoon, boys and young men will
often sail out in small canoes on mere pleasure cruises, when they race
each other, explore less familiar nooks of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb108" href="#pb108" name=
"pb108">108</a>]</span>Lagoon, and in general undoubtedly enjoy the
outing, in just the same manner as we would do.</p>
<p>Seen from outside, after you have grasped its construction and
appreciated through personal experience its fitness for its purpose,
the canoe is no less attractive and full of character than from within.
When, on a trading expedition or as a visiting party, a fleet of native
canoes appears in the offing, with their triangular sails like
butterfly wings scattered over the water (see <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e4053" title="Source: Plates">Plate</span> <a href=
"#pl48">XLVIII</a>), with the harmonious calls of conch shells blown in
unison, the effect is unforgettable.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4059src" href="#xd26e4059" name="xd26e4059src">2</a> When the
canoes then approach, and you see them rocking in the blue water in all
the splendour of their fresh white, red, and black paint, with their
finely designed <span class="corr" id="xd26e4065" title=
"Source: prowboards">prow-boards</span>, and clanking array of large,
white cowrie shells (see Plates <a href="#pl49">XLIX</a>, <a href=
"#pl55">LV</a>)&mdash;you understand well the admiring love which
results in all this care bestowed by the native on the decoration of
his canoe.</p>
<p>Even when not in actual use, when lying idle beached on the sea
front of a village, the canoe is a characteristic element in the
scenery, not without its share in the village life. The very big canoes
are in some cases housed in large sheds (see Plate <a href=
"#pl22">XXII</a>), which are by far the largest buildings erected by
the Trobrianders. In other villages, where sailing is always being
done, a canoe is simply covered with palm leaves (see Plates <a href=
"#pl01">I</a>, <a href="#pl53">LIII</a>), as protection from the sun,
and the natives often sit on its platform, chatting, and chewing
betel-nut, and gazing at the sea. The smaller canoes, beached near the
sea-front in long parallel rows, are ready to be launched at any
moment. With their curved outline and intricate framework of poles and
sticks, they form one of the most characteristic settings of a native
coastal village.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A few words must be said now about the technological
essentials of the canoe. Here again, a simple enumeration of the
various parts of the canoe, and a description of them, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb109" href="#pb109" name="pb109">109</a>]</span>a
pulling to pieces of a lifeless object will not satisfy us. I shall
instead try to show how, given its purpose on the one hand, and the
limitations in technical means and in material on the other, the native
ship-builders have coped with the difficulties before them.</p>
<p>A sailing craft requires a water-tight, immersible vessel of some
considerable volume. This is supplied to our natives by a hollowed-out
log. Such a log might carry fairly heavy loads, for wood is light, and
the hollowed space adds to its buoyancy. Yet it possesses no lateral
stability, as can easily be seen. A look at the diagrammatic section of
a canoe <a href="#fig1">Fig. I (1)</a>, shows that a weight with its
centre of gravity in the middle, that is, distributed symmetrically,
will not upset the equilibrium, but any load placed so as to produce a
momentum of rotation (that is, a turning force) at the sides (as
indicated by arrows at A or B) will cause the canoe to turn round and
capsize.</p>
<div class="figure fig1width" id="fig1"><img src="images/fig1.png" alt=
"Figure I&mdash;Diagram showing in transversal section some principles of canoe stability and construction."
width="603" height="341">
<p class="figureHead">Figure I&mdash;Diagram showing in transversal
section some principles of canoe stability and construction.</p>
</div>
<p>If, however, as shown in <a href="#fig1">Fig. I (2)</a>, another
smaller, solid log (C) be attached to the dug-out, a greater stability
is achieved, though not a symmetrical one. If we press down the one
side of the canoe (A) this will cause the canoe to turn round a
longitudinal axis, so that its other side (B) is raised, <a href=
"#fig1">Fig. I (3)</a>. The log (C) will be lifted out of the water,
and its weight will produce a momentum (turning force) proportional to
the displacement, and the rest of the canoe will come to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name=
"pb110">110</a>]</span>equilibrium. This momentum is represented in the
diagram by the arrow R. Thus a great stability relative to any stress
exercised upon A, will be achieved. A stress on B causes the log to be
immersed, to which its buoyancy opposes a slight resistance. But it can
easily be seen that the stability on this side is much smaller than on
the other. This <span class="corr" id="xd26e4113" title=
"Source: assymetrical">asymmetrical</span><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e4115src" href="#xd26e4115" name="xd26e4115src">3</a> stability
plays a great part in the technique of sailing. Thus, as we shall see,
the canoe is always so sailed that its outrigger float (C) remains in
the wind side. The pressure of the sail then lifts the canoe, so that A
is pressed into the water, and B and C are lifted, a position in which
they are extremely stable, and can stand great force of wind. Whereas
the slightest breeze would cause the canoe to turn turtle, if it fell
on the other side, and thus pressed B&mdash;C into the water.</p>
<p>Another look at <a href="#fig1">Fig. I (2)</a> and (3) will help us
to realise that the stability of the canoe will depend upon (i) the
volume, and especially the depth of the dug-out; (ii) the distance
B&mdash;C between the dug-out and the log; (iii) the size of the log C.
The greater all these three magnitudes are, the greater the stability
of the canoes. A shallow canoe, without much freeboard, will be easily
forced into the water; moreover, if sailed in rough weather, waves will
break over it, and fill it with water.</p>
<p>(i) <i>The volume of the dug-out log</i> naturally depends upon the
length, and thickness of the log. Fairly stable canoes are made of
simply scooped-out logs. There are limits, however, to the capacity of
these, which are very soon reached. But by building out the side, by
adding one or several planks to them, as shown in <a href=
"#fig1">Figure I (4)</a> the volume and the depth can be greatly
increased without much increase in weight. So that such a canoe has a
good deal of freeboard to prevent water from breaking in. The
longitudinal boards in Kiriwinian canoes are closed in at each end by
transversal prow-boards, which are also carved with more or less
perfection (see Plates <a href="#pl24">XXIV c</a>, <a href=
"#pl47">XLVII</a>).</p>
<p>(ii) <i>The greater the distance B&mdash;C between dug-out and
outrigger float</i>, the greater the stability of the canoe. Since
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name=
"pb111">111</a>]</span>the momentum of rotation is the product of
B&mdash;C (<a href="#fig1">Fig. I</a>), and the weight of the log C, it
is clear, therefore, that the greater the distance, the greater will be
the momentum. Too great a distance, however, would interfere with the
wieldiness of the canoe. Any force acting on the log would easily tip
the canoe, and as the natives, in order to manage the craft, have to
walk upon the outrigger, the distance B&mdash;C must not be too great.
In the Trobriands the distance B&mdash;C is about one-quarter, or less,
of the total length of the canoe. In the big, sea-going canoes, it is
always covered with a platform. In certain other districts, the
distance is much bigger, and the canoes have another type of
rigging.</p>

</div>
<p>(iii) <i>The size of the log (C) of which the float is formed</i>.
This, in sea-going canoes, is usually of considerable dimensions. But,
as a solid piece of wood becomes heavy if soaked by water, too thick a
log would not be good.</p>
<p>These are all the essentials of construction in their functional
aspect, which will make clear further descriptions of sailing, of
building, and of using. For, indeed, though I have said that
technicalities are of secondary importance, still without grasping
them, we cannot understand references to the managing and rigging of
the canoes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Trobrianders use their craft for three main purposes, and these
correspond to the three types of canoe. Coastal transport, especially
in the Lagoon, requires small, light, handy canoes called <i lang=
"kij">kewo&rsquo;u</i> (see <a href="#fig2">Fig. II (1)</a>, and Plates
<a href="#pl24">XXIV</a>, top foreground, and <a href=
"#pl36">XXXVI</a>, to the right); for fishing, bigger and more
seaworthy canoes called <i lang="kij">kalipoulo</i> (see <a href=
"#fig2">Fig. II (2)</a>, and Plates <a href="#pl24">XXIV</a>, and
<a href="#pl36">XXXVI</a>, to the left, also <a href=
"#pl37">XXXVII</a>) are used; finally, for deep sea sailing, the
biggest type is needed, with a considerable carrying capacity, greater
displacement, and stronger construction. These are called <i lang=
"kij">masawa</i> (see <a href="#fig2">Fig. II (3)</a> and Plates
<a href="#pl21">XXI</a>, <a href="#pl23">XXIII</a>, etc.). The word
<i lang="kij">waga</i> is a general designation for all kinds of
sailing craft.</p>
<p>Only a few words need to be said about the first two types, so as to
make, by means of comparison, the third type clearer. The construction
of the smallest canoes is sufficiently illustrated by the diagram (1)
in <a href="#fig2">Fig. II</a>. From this it is clear that it is a
simple dug-out log, connected with a float. It never has any built-up
planking, and no carved boards, nor as a rule any platform. In its
economic aspect, it is always owned by one individual, and serves his
personal needs. No mythology or magic is attached to it.</p>
<p>Type (2), as can be seen in <a href="#fig2">Fig. II (2)</a>, differs
in construction from (1), in so far that it has its well enclosed by
built-out planking and carved prow-boards. A framework of six ribs
helps to keep the planks firmly attached to the dug-out and to hold
them together. It is used in fishing villages. These villages are
organised into several fishing detachments, each with a headman. He is
the owner of the canoe, he performs the fish magic, and among other
privileges, obtains the main yield of fish. But all his crew <i lang=
"la">de facto</i> have the right to use the canoe and share in the
yield. Here we come across the fact that native ownership is not a
simple institution, since it implies definite rights of a number of
men, combined with the paramount right and title of one. There is a
good deal of fishing magic, taboos and customs connected with the
construction of these canoes, and also with their use, and they form
the subject of a number of minor myths.</p>

the outrigger to the hull, the prow, the prow-boards and the platform.
(See <a href="#div4.2">Div. II</a>.)</p>
</div>
<p>By far the most elaborate technically, the most seaworthy and
carefully built, are the sea-going canoes of the third type (see
<a href="#fig2">Fig. II (3)</a>). These are undoubtedly the greatest
achievement of craftsmanship of these natives. Technically,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name=
"pb113">113</a>]</span>they differ from the previously described kinds,
in the amount of time spent over their construction and the care given
to details, rather than in essentials. The well is formed by a planking
built over a hollowed log and closed up at both ends by carved,
transversal prow-boards, kept in position by others, longitudinal and
of oval form. The whole planking remains in place by means of ribs, as
in the second type of canoes, the <i lang="kij">kalipoulo</i>, the
fishing canoes, but all the parts are finished and fitted much more
perfectly, lashed with a better creeper, and more thoroughly caulked.
The carving, which in the fishing canoes is often quite indifferent,
here is perfect. Ownership of these canoes is even more complex, and
its construction is permeated with tribal customs, ceremonial, and
magic, the last based on mythology. The magic is always performed in
direct association with Kula expeditions.</p>

<p class="first">After having thus spoken about, first, the general
impression made by a canoe and its psychological import, and then about
the fundamental features of its technology, we have to turn to the
social implications of a <i lang="kij">masawa</i> (sea-going
canoe).</p>
<p>The canoe is constructed by a group of people, it is owned, used and
enjoyed communally, and this is done according to definite rules. There
is therefore a social organisation underlying the building, the owning,
and the sailing of a canoe. Under these three headings, we shall give
an outline of the canoe&rsquo;s sociology, always bearing in mind that
these outlines have to be filled in in the subsequent account.</p>
<p>(A) <i>Social organisation of labour in constructing a
Canoe</i>.</p>
<p>In studying the construction of a canoe, we see the natives engaged
in an economic enterprise on a big scale. Technical difficulties face
them, which require knowledge, and can only be overcome by a
continuous, systematic effort, and at certain stages must be met by
means of communal labour. All this obviously implies some social
organisation. All the stages of work, at which various people have to
co-operate, must be co-ordinated, there must be someone in authority
who takes the initiative and gives decisions; and there must be also
someone with a technical capacity, who directs the construction.
Finally, in Kiriwina, communal labour, and the services <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name="pb114">114</a>]</span>of
experts have to be paid for, and there must be someone who has the
means and is prepared to do it.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4274src"
href="#xd26e4274" name="xd26e4274src">4</a> This economic organisation
rests on two fundamental facts&mdash;(1) the sociological
differentiation of functions, and (2) the magical regulation of
work.</p>
<p>(1) <i>The sociological differentiation of
functions</i>.&mdash;First of all there is the owner of the canoe, that
is, the chief, or the headman of a village or of a smaller
sub-division, who takes the responsibility for the undertaking. He pays
for the work, engages the expert, gives orders, and commands communal
labour.</p>
<p>Besides the owner, there is next another office of great
sociological importance, namely, that of the expert. He is the man who
knows how to construct the canoe, how to do the carvings, and, last,
not least, how to perform the magic. All these functions of the expert
may be, but not necessarily are, united in one person. The owner is
always one individual, but there may be two or even three experts.</p>
<p>Finally, the third sociological factor in canoe-building, consists
of the workers. And here there is a further division. First there is a
smaller group, consisting of the relations and close friends of the
owner or of the expert, who help throughout the whole process of
construction; and, secondly, there is, besides them, the main body of
villagers, who take part in the work at those stages where communal
labour is necessary.</p>
<p>(2) <i>The magical regulation of work</i>.&mdash;The belief in the
efficiency of magic is supreme among the natives of Boyowa, and they
associate it with all their vital concerns. In fact, we shall find
magic interwoven into all the many industrial and communal activities
to be described later on, as well as associated with every pursuit
where either danger or chance conspicuously enter. We shall have to
describe, besides the magic of canoe-making, that of propitious
sailing, of shipwreck and salvage, of Kula and of trade, of fishing, of
obtaining <i>spondylus</i> and <i>Conus</i> shell, and of protection
against attack in foreign parts. It is imperative that we should
thoroughly grasp what magic means to the natives and the r&ocirc;le it
plays in all their vital pursuits, and a special chapter will be
devoted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>to magical ideas and magical practices in
Kiriwina. Here, however, it is necessary to sketch the main outlines,
at least as far as canoe magic is concerned.</p>
<p>First of all, it must be realised that the natives firmly believe in
the value of magic, and that this conviction, when put to the test of
their actions, is quite unwavering, even nowadays when so much of
native belief and custom has been undermined. We may speak of the
sociological weight of tradition, that is of the degree to which the
behaviour of a community is affected by the traditional commands of
tribal law and customs. In the Trobriands, the general injunction for
always building canoes under the guidance of magic is obeyed without
the slightest deviation, for the tradition here weighs very heavily. Up
to the present, not one single <i lang="kij">masawa</i> canoe has been
constructed without magic, indeed without the full observance of all
the rites and ceremonial. The forces that keep the natives to their
traditional course of behaviour are, in the first place, the specific
social inertia which obtains in all human societies and is the basis of
all conservative tendencies, and then the strong conviction that if the
traditional course were not taken, evil results would ensue. In the
case of canoes, the Trobrianders would be so firmly persuaded that a
canoe built without magic would be unseaworthy, slow in sailing, and
unlucky in the Kula, that no one would dream of omitting the magic
rites.</p>
<p>In the myths related elsewhere (<a href="#ch12">Chap. XII</a>) we
shall see plainly the power ascribed to magic in imparting speed and
other qualities to a canoe. According to native mythology, which is
literally accepted, and strongly believed, canoes could be even made to
fly, had not the necessary magic fallen into oblivion.</p>
<p>It is also important to understand rightly the natives&rsquo; ideas
about the relation between magical efficiency and the results of
craftsmanship. Both are considered indispensable, but both are
understood to act independently. That is, the natives will understand
that magic, however efficient, will not make up for bad workmanship.
Each of these two has its own province: the builder by his skill and
knowledge makes the canoe stable and swift, and magic gives it an
additional stability and swiftness. If a canoe is obviously badly
built, the natives will know why it sails slowly and is unwieldy.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>But if one of two canoes, both apparently
equally well constructed surpasses the other in some respect, this will
be attributed to magic.</p>
<p>Finally, speaking from a sociological point of view, what is the
economic function of magic in the process of canoe making? Is it simply
an extraneous action, having nothing to do with the real work or its
organisation? Is magic, from the economic point of view, a mere waste
of time? By no means. In reading the account which follows, it will be
seen clearly that magic puts order and sequence into the various
activities, and that it and its associated ceremonial are instrumental
in securing the co-operation of the community, and the organisation of
communal labour. As has been said before, it inspires the builders with
great confidence in the efficiency of their work, a mental state
essential in any enterprise of complicated and difficult character. The
belief that the magician is a man endowed with special powers,
<span class="corr" id="xd26e4324" title=
"Source: controling">controlling</span> the canoe, makes him a natural
leader whose command is obeyed, who can fix dates, apportion work, and
keep the worker up to the mark.</p>
<p>Magic, far from being a useless appendage, or even a burden on the
work, supplies the psychological influence, which keeps people
confident about the success of their labour, and provides them with a
sort of natural leader.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4329src" href=
"#xd26e4329" name="xd26e4329src">5</a> Thus the organisation of labour
in canoe-building rests on the one hand on the division of functions,
those of the owner, the expert and the helpers, and on the other on the
co-operation between labour and magic.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">(B) <i>Sociology of Canoe Ownership</i>.</p>
<p>Ownership, giving this word its broadest sense, is the relation,
often very complex, between an object and the social community in which
it is found. In ethnology it is extremely important not to use this
word in any narrower sense than that just defined, because the types of
ownership found in various parts of the world differ widely. It is
especially a grave <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117"
name="pb117">117</a>]</span>error to use the word ownership with the
very definite connotation given to it in our own society. For it is
obvious that this connotation presupposes the existence of very highly
developed economic and legal conditions, such as they are amongst
ourselves, and therefore the term &ldquo;own&rdquo; as we use it is
meaningless, when applied to a native society. Or indeed, what is
worse, such an application smuggles a number of preconceived ideas into
our description, and before we have begun to give an account of the
native conditions, we have distorted the reader&rsquo;s outlook.</p>
<p>Ownership has naturally in every type of native society, a different
specific meaning, as in each type, custom and tradition attach a
different set of functions, rites and privileges to the word. Moreover,
the social range of those who enjoy these privileges varies. Between
pure individual ownership and collectivism, there is a whole scale of
intermediate blendings and combinations.</p>
<p>In the Trobriands, there is a word which may be said approximately
to denote ownership, the prefix <i lang="kij">toli</i>&mdash;followed
by the name of the object owned. Thus the compound word (pronounced
without hiatus) <i lang="kij">toli-waga</i>, means &ldquo;owner&rdquo;
or &ldquo;master&rdquo; of a canoe (<i lang="kij">waga</i>); <i lang=
"kij">toli-bagula</i>, the master of the garden (<i lang=
"kij">bagula</i>&mdash;garden); <i lang="kij">toli-bunukwa</i>, owner
of the pig; <i lang="kij">toli-megwa</i> (owner, expert in magic, etc.)
This word has to be used as a clue to the understanding of native
ideas, but here again such a clue must be used with caution. For, in
the first place, like all abstract native words, it covers a wide
range, and has different meanings in different contexts. And even with
regard to one object, a number of people may lay claim to ownership,
claim to be <i lang="kij">toli</i>&mdash;with regard to it. In the
second place, people having the full <i lang="la">de facto</i> right of
using an object, might not be allowed to call themselves <i lang=
"kij">toli</i>&mdash;of this object. This will be made clear in the
concrete example of the canoe.</p>
<p>The word <i lang="kij">toli</i>&mdash;in this example is restricted
to one man only, who calls himself <i lang="kij">toli-waga</i>.
Sometimes his nearest maternal relatives, such as his brothers and
maternal nephews, might call themselves collectively <i lang=
"kij">toli-waga</i>, but this would be an abuse of the term. Now, even
the mere privilege of using exclusively this title is very highly
valued by the natives. With this feature of the Trobriand social
psychology, that is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href="#pb118"
name="pb118">118</a>]</span>with their characteristic ambition, vanity
and desire to be renowned and well spoken of, the reader of the
following pages will become very familiar. The natives, to whom the
Kula and the sailing expeditions are so important, will associate the
name of the canoe with that of its <i lang="kij">toli</i>; they will
identify his magical powers and its good luck in sailing and in the
Kula; they will often speak of So-and-so&rsquo;s sailing here and
there, of his being very fast in sailing, etc., using in this the
man&rsquo;s name for that of the canoe.</p>
<p>Turning now to the detailed determination of this relationship, the
most important point about it is that it always rests in the person of
the chief or headman. As we have seen in our short account of the
Trobrianders&rsquo; sociology, the village community is always subject
to the authority of one chief or headman. Each one of these, whether
his authority extends over a small sectional village, or over a whole
district, has the means of accumulating a certain amount of garden
produce, considerable in the case of a chief, relatively small in that
of a headman, but always sufficient to defray the extra expenses
incidental to all communal enterprise. He also owns native wealth
condensed into the form of the objects of value called <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>. Again, a headman will have little, a big chief
a large amount. But everyone who is not a mere nobody, must possess at
least a few stone blades, a few <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> belts, and
some <i lang="kij">kuwa</i> (small necklets). Thus in all types of
tribal enterprises, the chief or headman is able to bear the burden of
expense, and he also derives the main benefit from the affair. In the
case of the canoe, the chief, as we saw, acts as main organiser in the
construction, and he also enjoys the title of <i lang=
"kij">toli</i>.</p>
<p>This strong economic position runs side by side with his direct
power, due to high rank, or traditional authority. In the case of a
small headman, it is due to the fact that he is at the head of a big
kinship group (the totemic sub-clan). Both combined, allow him to
command labour and to reward for it.</p>
<p>This title of <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>, besides the general social
distinction which it confers, implies further a definite series of
social functions with regard to its individual bearer.</p>
<p>(1) There are first the formal and ceremonial privileges. Thus, the
<i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> has the privilege of acting as spokesman of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>his community in all matters of sailing or
construction. He assembles the council, informal or formal as the case
may be, and opens the question of when the sailing will take place.
This right of initiative is <a id="xd26e4429" name=
"xd26e4429"></a>purely a nominal one, because both in construction and
sailing, the date of enterprise is determined by outward causes, such
as reciprocity to overseas tribes, seasons, customs, etc. Nevertheless,
the formal privilege is strictly confined to the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i>, and highly valued. The position of master and
leader of ceremonies, of general spokesman, lasts right through the
successive stages of the building of the canoe, and its subsequent use,
and we shall meet with it in all the ceremonial phases of the Kula.</p>
<p>(2) The economic uses and advantages derived from a canoe are not
limited to the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>. He, however, gets the
lion&rsquo;s share. He has, of course, in all circumstances, the
privilege of absolute priority in being included in the party. He also
receives always by far the greatest proportion of Kula valuables, and
other articles on every occasion. This, however, is in virtue of his
general position as chief or headman, and should perhaps not be
included under this heading. But a very definite and strictly
individual advantage is that of being able to dispose of the canoe for
hire, and of receiving the payment for it. The canoe can be, and often
is, hired out from a headman, who at a given season has no intention of
sailing, by another one, as a rule from a different district, who
embarks on an expedition. The reason of this is, that the chief or
headman who borrows, may at that time not be able to have his own canoe
repaired, or construct another new one. The payment for hire is called
<i lang="kij">toguna</i>, and it consists of a <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>. Besides this, the best <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> obtained on the expedition would be
kula&rsquo;d to the man from whom the canoe was hired.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e4448src" href="#xd26e4448" name=
"xd26e4448src">6</a></p>
<p>(3) The <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> has definite social privileges,
and exercises definite functions, in the running of a canoe. Thus, he
selects his companions, who will sail in his canoe, and has the nominal
right to choose or reject those who may go on the expedition with him.
Here again the privilege is much shorn of its <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>value by many restrictions imposed on the chief
by the nature of things. Thus, on the one hand, his <i lang=
"kij">veyola</i> (maternal kinsmen) have, according to all native ideas
of right and law, a strong claim on the canoe. Again, a man of rank in
a community could be excluded from an expedition only with difficulty,
if he wished to go and there were no special grievance against him. But
if there were such a cause, if the man had offended the chief, and were
on bad terms with him, he himself would not even try to embark. There
are actual examples of this on record. Another class of people having a
<i lang="la">de facto</i> right to sail are the sailing experts. In the
coastal villages like Sinaketa there are many of these; in inland ones,
like Omarakana, there are few. So in one of these inland places, there
are men who always go in a canoe, whenever it is used; who have even a
good deal to say in all matters connected with sailing, yet who would
never dare to use the title of <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>, and would
even definitely disclaim it if it were given to them. To sum up: the
chief&rsquo;s privilege of choice is limited by two conditions, the
rank and the seamanship of those he may select. As we have seen, he
fulfils definite functions in the construction of the canoe. We shall
see later on that he has also definite functions in sailing.</p>
<p>(4) A special feature, implied in the title of <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i>, is the performance of magical duties. It will be
made clear that magic during the process of construction is done by the
expert, but magic done in connection with sailing and Kula is done by
the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>. The latter must, by definition, know
canoe magic. The r&ocirc;le of magic in this, and the taboos,
ceremonial activities, and special customs associated with it, will
come out clearly in the consecutive account of a Kula expedition.</p>

<p class="first">(<span class="corr" id="xd26e4490" title=
"Source: 3">C</span>) <i>The Social Division of Functions in the
Manning and Sailing</i> of <i>the Canoe</i>.</p>
<p>Very little is to be said under this heading here, since to
understand this we must know more about the technicalities of sailing.
We shall deal with this subject later on (<a href="#div9.2">Chap. IX,
Div. II</a>), and there the social organisation within the
canoe&mdash;such as it is&mdash;will be indicated. Here it may be said
that a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span>number of men have definite tasks assigned to
them, and they keep to these. As a rule a man will specialise, let us
say, as steersman, and will always have the rudder given to his care.
Captainship, carrying with it definite duties, powers and
responsibilities, as a position distinct from that of the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i>, does not exist. The owner of the canoe will always
take the lead and give orders, provided that he is a good sailor.
Otherwise the best sailor from the crew will say what is to be done
when difficulties or dangers arise. As a rule, however, everyone knows
his task, and everyone performs it in the normal course of events.</p>
<p>A short outline of the concrete details referring to the
distribution of canoes in the Trobriands must be given here. A glance
at the map of Boyowa shows that various districts have not the same
opportunities for sailing, and not all of them direct access to the
sea. Moreover, the fishing villages on the Lagoon, where fishing and
sailing have constantly to be done, will naturally have more
opportunities for cultivating the arts of sailing and ship-building.
And indeed we find that the villages of the two inland districts,
Tilataula and Kuboma, know nothing about ship-building and sailing, and
possess no canoes; the villages in Kiriwina and Luba, on the east
coast, with indirect access to the sea, have only one canoe each, and
few building experts; while some villagers on the Lagoon are good
sailors and excellent builders. The best centres for canoe-building are
found in the islands of Vakuta and Kayleula and to a lesser degree this
craft flourishes in the village of Sinaketa. The island of Kitava is
the traditional building centre, and at present the finest canoes as
well as the best canoe carvings come from there. In this description of
canoes, this island, which really belongs to the Eastern rather than to
the Western branch of the N. Massim, must be included in the account,
since all Boyowan canoe mythology and canoe industry is associated with
Kitava.</p>
<p>There are at present some sixty-four Masawa canoes in the Trobriands
and Kitava. Out of these, some four belong to the Northern district,
where Kula is not practised; all the rest are built and used for the
Kula. In the foregoing chapters I have spoken about &ldquo;Kula
communities,&rdquo; that is, such groups of villages as carry on the
Kula as a whole, sail together on overseas expeditions, and do their
internal Kula with one <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href=
"#pb122" name="pb122">122</a>]</span>another. We shall group the canoes
according to the Kula community to which they belong.</p>

<p>To this number, the canoes of the Northern district must be added,
but they are never used in the Kula. In olden days, this figure was, on
a rough estimate, more than double of what it is now, because, first of
all, there are some villages which had canoes in the old days and now
have none, and then the number of villages which became extinct a few
generations ago is considerable. About half a century ago, there were
in Vakuta alone about sixty canoes, in Sinaketa at least twenty, in
Kitava thirty, in Kiriwina twenty, and in Luba ten. When all the canoes
from Sinaketa and Vakuta sailed south, and some twenty to thirty more
joined them from the Amphletts and Tewara, quite a stately fleet would
approach Dobu.</p>
<p>Turning now to the list of ownership in Kiriwina, the most important
canoe is, of course, that owned by the chief of Omarakana. This canoe
always leads the fleet; that is to say, on big ceremonial Kula
sailings, called <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>, it has the privileged
position. It lives in a big shed on the beach of Kaulukuba (see Plates
<a href="#pl22">XXII</a>, <a href="#pl30">XXX</a>), distant about one
mile from the village, the beach on which also each new canoe is made.
The present canoe (see Plates <a href="#pl21">XXI</a> and <a href=
"#pl41">XLI</a>) is called Nigada Bu&rsquo;a&mdash;&ldquo;begging for
an areca-nut.&rdquo; Every canoe has a personal name of its own,
sometimes just an appropriate expression, like the one quoted,
sometimes derived from some special incident. When a new canoe is
built, it often inherits the name of its predecessor, but sometimes it
gets a new name. The present Omarakana canoe was constructed by a
master-builder from Kitava, who also carved the ornamental <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e4599" title="Source: prowboard">prow-board</span>.
There is no one now in Omarakana who can build or carve properly. The
magic over the latter stages ought to have been recited by the present
chief, To&rsquo;uluwa, but as he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123"
href="#pb123" name="pb123">123</a>]</span>has very little capacity for
remembering spells, the magic was performed by one of his kinsmen.</p>
<p>All the other canoes of Kiriwina are also housed in hangars, each on
a beach of clean, white sand on the Eastern coast. The chief or headman
of each village is the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>. In Kasana&rsquo;i,
the sub-village of Omarakana, the canoe, called in feigned modesty
<i lang="kij">tokwabu</i> (something like &ldquo;landlubber&rdquo;),
was built by Ibena, a chief of equal rank, but smaller power than
To&rsquo;uluwa, and he is also the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>. Some
other characteristic names of the canoes
are:&mdash;Kuyamataym&rsquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Take care of yourself,&rdquo;
that is, &ldquo;because I shall get ahead of you&rdquo;; the canoe of
Liluta, called Siya&rsquo;i, which is the name of a Government station,
where some people from Liluta were once imprisoned; Topusa&mdash;a
flying fish; Yagwa&rsquo;u&mdash;a scarecrow;
Akamta&rsquo;u&mdash;&ldquo;I shall eat men,&rdquo; because the canoe
was a gift from the cannibals of Dobu.</p>
<p>In the district of Luba there are at present only three canoes; one
belongs to the chief of highest rank in the village of Olivilevi. This
is the biggest canoe in all the Trobriands. Two are in the village of
Wawela, and belong to two headmen, each ruling over a section of the
village; one of them is seen being relashed on <a href="#pl27">Plate
XXVII</a>.</p>
<p>The big settlement of Sinaketa, consisting of sectional villages,
has also canoes. There are about four expert builders and carvers, and
almost every man there knows a good deal about construction. In Vakuta
the experts are even more numerous, and this is also the case in
Kayleula and Kitava. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb124" href="#pb124"

Comparing the frail yet clumsy native canoe with a fine European yacht,
we feel inclined to regard the former almost in the light of a joke.
This is the pervading note in many amateur ethnographic accounts of
sailing, where cheap fun is made by speaking of roughly hewn dug-outs
in terms of &ldquo;dreadnoughts&rdquo; or &ldquo;Royal Yachts,&rdquo;
just as simple, savage chiefs are referred to as &ldquo;Kings&rdquo; in
a jocular vein. Such humour is doubtless natural and refreshing, but
when we approach these matters scientifically, on the one hand we must
refrain from any distortion of facts, and on the other, enter into the
finer shades of the natives&rsquo; thought and feeling with regard to
his own, creations.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

crab-claw sails, used on the South Coast, from Mailu where I used to

In fact, I can hardly imagine anything more strangely impressive than a
fleet of crab-claw sailed canoes. They have been depicted in the
British New Guinea stamp, as issued by Captain Francis Barton, the late
Governor of the Colony. See also Plate XII of Seligman&rsquo;s

<p class="first">The building of the sea-going canoe (<i lang=
"kij">masawa</i>) is inextricably bound up with the general proceedings
of the Kula. As we have said before, in all villages where Kula is
practised the <i lang="kij">masawa</i> canoes are built and repaired
only in direct connection with it. That is, as soon as a Kula
expedition is decided upon, and its date fixed, all the canoes of the
village must be overhauled, and those too old for repair must be
replaced by new ones. As the overhauling differs only slightly from
building in the later, ceremonial stages of the procedure, the account
in this chapter covers both.</p>
<p>To the native, the construction of the canoe is the first link in
the chain of the Kula performances. From the moment that the tree is
felled till the return of the oversea party, there is one continuous
flow of events, following in regular succession. Not only that: as we
shall see, the technicalities of construction are interrupted and
punctuated by magical rites. Some of these refer to the canoe, others
belong to the Kula. Thus, canoe-building and the first stage of Kula
dovetail into one another. Again, the launching of the canoe, and
especially the <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i> (the formal presentation
visit) are in one respect the final acts of canoe-building, and in
another they belong to the Kula. In giving the account of
canoe-building, therefore, we start on the long sequence of events
which form a Kula expedition. No account of the Kula could be
considered complete in which canoe-building had been omitted.</p>

</div>
<p>In this chapter, the incidents will be related one after the other
as they happen in the normal routine of tribal life, obeying the
commands of custom, and the indications of belief, the latter acting
more rigidly and strongly even than the former. It will be necessary,
in following this consecutive account, to keep in mind the definite,
sociological mechanism <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125" href=
"#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>underlying the activities, and the
system of ideas at work in regulating labour and magic. The social
organisation has been described in the previous chapter. We shall
remember that the owner, the expert or experts, a small group of
helpers, and the whole community are the social factors, each of which
fulfils a different function in the organisation and performance of
work. As to the magical ideas which govern the various rites, they will
be analysed later on in the course of this and some of the following
chapters, and also in <a href="#ch17">Chapter XVII</a>. Here it must
suffice to say that they belong to several different systems of ideas.
The one based on the myth of the flying canoe refers directly to the
canoe; it aims at imparting a general excellence, and more especially
the quality of speed to the canoe. The rites of the other type are
really exorcisms directed against evil bewitchment (<i lang=
"kij">bulubwalata</i>) of which the natives are much afraid. The third
system of magic (performed during canoe construction) is the Kula
magic, based on its own mythological cycle, and although performed on
the canoe, yet aiming at the imparting of success to the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> in his Kula transactions. Finally, at the beginnings
of the proceedings there is some magic addressed to the <i lang=
"kij">tokway</i>, the malignant <span class="corr" id="xd26e4694"
title="Source: wood sprite">wood-sprite</span>.</p>
<p>The construction of the canoe is done in two main stages, differing
from one another in the character of the work, in the accompanying
magic, and in the general sociological setting. In the first stage, the
component parts of the canoe are prepared. A big tree is cut, trimmed
into a log, then hollowed out and made into the basic dug-out; the
planks, boards, poles, and sticks are prepared. This is achieved by
slow, leisurely work, and it is done by the canoe-builder with the
assistance of a few helpers, usually his relatives or friends or else
those of the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>. This stage generally takes a
long time, some two to six months, and is done in fits and starts, as
other occupations allow, or the mood comes. The spells and rites which
accompany it belong to the <i lang="kij">tokway</i> magic, and to that
of the flying canoe cycle. To this first stage also belongs the carving
of the decorative prow-boards. This is done sometimes by the builder,
sometimes by another expert, if the builder cannot carve.</p>
<p>The second stage is done by means of intense communal labour. As a
rule this stage is spread over a short time, only perhaps a week or
two&mdash;including the pauses between work. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name="pb126">126</a>]</span>The
actual labour, in which the whole community is energetically engaged,
takes up only some three to five days. The work consists of the piecing
together of the planks and <span class="corr" id="xd26e4709" title=
"Source: prowboards">prow-boards</span>, and, in case these do not fit
well, of trimming them appropriately, and then of the lashing them
together. Next comes the piecing and lashing of the outrigger, caulking
and painting of the canoe. Sail-making is also done at this time, and
belongs to this stage. As a rule, the main body of the canoe is
constructed at one sitting, lasting about a day; that is, the
prow-boards are put in, the ribs and planks fitted together, trimmed
and lashed. Another day is devoted to the attaching of the float and
binding of the outrigger frame and the platform. Caulking and painting
are done at another sitting, or perhaps at two more, while the sail is
made on yet another day. These times are only approximate, since the
size of the canoe, as well as the number of people participating in
communal labour, greatly varies. The second stage of canoe-building is
accompanied by Kula magic, and by a series of exorcisms on the canoe,
and the magic is performed by the owner of the canoe, and not by the
builder or expert. This latter, however, directs the technicalities of
the proceedings, in which he is assisted and advised by builders from
other villages; by sailing experts, and by the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> and other notables. The lashing of the canoe with a
specially strong creeper, called <i lang="kij">wayugo</i>, is
accompanied by perhaps the most important of the rites and spells
belonging to the flying canoe magic.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After the decision to build a <i lang="kij">waga</i>
has been taken, a tree suitable for the main log has to be chosen.
This, in the Trobriands, is not a very easy task. As the whole plain is
taken up by garden land, only the small patches of fertile soil in the
coral ridge which runs all round the island, remain covered with
jungle. There the tree must be found, there felled, and thence
transported to the village.</p>
<p>Once the tree is chosen, the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>, the builder
and a few helpers repair to the spot, and a preliminary rite must be
performed, before they begin to cut it down. A small incision is made
into the trunk, so that a particle of food, or a bit of areca-nut can
be put into it. Giving this as an offering to the <i lang=
"kij">tokway</i> (<span class="corr" id="xd26e4734" title=
"Source: wood sprite">wood-sprite</span>), the magician utters an
incantation:&mdash; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127"

title="Source: wood sprites">wood-sprites</span>, O <i lang=

<p>&ldquo;Step down from our tree, old men! This is a canoe ill spoken

down!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This spell, given in free translation, which, however, follows the
original very closely, word for word, is far clearer than the average
sample of Trobriand magic. In the first part, the <i lang=
"kij">tokway</i> is invoked under various names, and invited to leave
his abode, and to move to some other place, and there to be at his
ease. In the second part, the canoe is mentioned with several epithets,
all of which denote an act of discourtesy or ill-omen. This is
obviously done to compel the <i lang="kij">tokway</i> to leave the
tree. In Boyowa, the <i lang="kij">yoba</i>, the chasing away, is under
circumstances a great insult, and at times it commands immediate
compliance. This is always the case when the chaser belongs to the
local sub-clan of a village, and the person expelled does not. But the
<i lang="kij">yoba</i> is always an act of considerable consequence,
never used lightly, and in this spell, it carries these sociological
associations with it. In the usual anticipatory way, characteristic of
native speech, the tree is called in the spell &ldquo;canoe&rdquo;
(<i lang="kij">waga</i>).</p>
<p>The object of this spell is written very plainly in every word of
it, and the natives also confirm it by saying that it is absolutely
necessary to get rid of the <i lang="kij">tokway</i>. What would
happen, however, if the <i lang="kij">tokway</i> were not expelled, is
not so unequivocally laid down by tradition, and it cannot be read out
of the spell or the rite. Some informants say that the canoe would be
heavy; others that the wood would be full of knots, and that there
would be holes in the canoe, or that it would quickly rot.</p>
<p>But though the rationale of the expulsion is not so well defined,
the belief in the <i lang="kij">tokway&rsquo;s</i> evil influence, and
in the dangers associated with his presence is positive. And this is in
keeping with the general nature of the <i lang="kij">tokway</i>, as we
find <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128" name=
"pb128">128</a>]</span>him delineated by native belief. The <i lang=
"kij">tokway</i> is on the whole a harmful being, though the harm he
does is seldom more than an unpleasant trick, perhaps a sudden fright,
an attack of shooting pains, or a theft. The <i lang="kij">tokway</i>
live in trees or in coral rocks and boulders, usually in the <i lang=
"kij">raybwag</i>, the primeval jungle, growing on the coastal ridge,
full of outcrops and rocks. Some people have seen a <i lang=
"kij">tokway</i>, although he is invisible at will. His skin is brown,
like that of any Boyowan, but he has long, sleek hair, and a long
beard. He comes often at night, and frightens people. But, though
seldom seen, the <i lang="kij">tokway&rsquo;s</i> wailing is often
heard from the branches of a big tree, and some trees evidently harbour
more <i lang="kij">tokways</i> than others, since you can hear them
very easily there. Sometimes, over such trees, where people often hear
the <i lang="kij">tokway</i> and get a fright, the above quoted
incantation and rite are performed.</p>
<p>In their contact with men, the <i lang="kij">tokway</i> show their
unpleasant side; often they come at night and steal food. Many cases
can be quoted when a man, as it seemed, was surprised in the act of
stealing yams out of a storehouse, but lo! when approached he
disappeared&mdash;it was a <i lang="kij">tokway</i>. Then, sickness in
some of its lighter forms is caused by the <i lang="kij">tokway</i>.
Shooting pains, pricking and stabbing in one&rsquo;s inside, are often
due to him, for he is in possession of magic by which he can insert
small, sharp-edged and sharp-pointed objects into the body. Fortunately
some men know magic by which to extract such objects. These men, of
course, according to the general rule of sorcery, can also inflict the
same ailments. In olden days, the <i lang="kij">tokway</i> gave both
the harmful and beneficent magic to some men, and ever since, this form
of sorcery and of concomitant healing have been handed on from one
generation to another.</p>
<p>Let us return to our canoe, however. After the rite has been
performed, the tree is felled. In olden days, when stone implements
were used, this must have been a laborious process, in which a number
of men were engaged in wielding the axe, and others in re-sharpening
the blunted or broken blades. The old technique was more like nibbling
away the wood in small chips, and it must have taken a long time to cut
out a sufficiently deep incision to fell the tree. After the tree is on
the ground, the preliminary trimming is done on the spot. The branches
are lopped off, and the log of appropriate length is made out of the
tree. This log is cut into the rough shape of a canoe, so <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb129" href="#pb129" name="pb129">129</a>]</span>as
to make it as light as possible, for now it has to be pulled to the
village or to the beach.</p>
<p>The transporting of the log is not an easy task, as it has to be
taken out of the uneven, rocky <i lang="kij">raybwag</i>, and then
pulled along very bad roads. Pieces of wood are put on the ground every
few metres, to serve as slips on which the log can more easily glide
than on the rocks and uneven soil. In spite of that, and in spite of
the fact that many men are summoned to assist, the work of pulling the
log is very heavy. The men receive food in payment for it. Pig flesh is
cooked and distributed with baked yams; at intervals during the work
they refresh themselves with green coco-nut drinks and with sucking
sugar cane. Gifts of such food, given during work in payment of
communal labour, are called <i lang="kij">puwaya</i>. To describe how
heavy the work sometimes is, the native will say, in a
characteristically figurative manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The pig, the coco drinks, the yams are
finished, and yet we pull&mdash;very heavy!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In such cases the natives resort to a magical rite which makes the
canoe lighter. A piece of dry banana leaf is put on top of the log. The
owner or builder beats the log with a bunch of dry lalang grass and
utters the following spell:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Kaymomwa&rsquo;u Spell.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Come down, come down, defilement by contact
with excrement! Come down, defilement by contact with refuse! Come
down, heaviness! Come down, rot! Come down fungus! &hellip;&rdquo; and
soon, invoking a number of deteriorations to leave the log, and then a
number of defilements and broken taboos. In other words, the heaviness
and slowness, due to all these magical causes, are thrown out of the
log.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This bunch of grass is then ritually thrown away. It is called
<i lang="kij">momwa&rsquo;u</i>, or the &ldquo;heavy bunch.&rdquo;
Another handful of the long lalang grass, seared and dry, is taken, and
this is the <i lang="kij">gagabile</i>, the &ldquo;light bunch,&rdquo;
and with this the canoe is again beaten. The meaning of the rite is
quite plain: the first bunch takes into it the heaviness of the log,
and the second imparts lightness to it. Both spells also express this
meaning in plain terms. The second spell, recited with the <i lang=
"kij">gagabile</i> bunch, runs thus: <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

</blockquote>
<p>These formul&aelig; are used both to make the log lighter for the
present purpose of pulling it into the village, and in order to give it
greater speed in general, when it is made up into a <i lang=
"kij">waga</i>.</p>
<p>After the log has been finally brought into the village, and left on
the <i lang="kij">baku</i>, the main central place, the creeper by
means of which it has been pulled and which is called in this
connection <i lang="kij">duku</i>, is not cut away at once. This is
done ceremonially on the morning of the following day, sometimes after
even two or three days have passed. The men of the community assemble,
and the one who will scoop out the canoe, the builder (<i lang=
"kij">tota&rsquo;ila waga</i>, &ldquo;the cutter of the canoe&rdquo;)
performs a magical rite. He takes his adze (<i lang="kij">ligogu</i>)
and wraps some very light and thin herbs round the blade with a piece
of dried banana leaf, itself associated with the idea of lightness.
This he wraps only half round, so that a broad opening is left, and the
breath and voice have free access to the herbs and blade of the adze.
Into this opening, the magician chants the following long spell:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Kapitunena Duku Spell.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;I shall wave them back, (i.e., prevent all
other canoes from overtaking me)!&rdquo; repeated many times. &ldquo;On
the top of Si&rsquo;a Hill; women of Tokuna; my mother a sorceress,
myself a sorcerer. It dashes forward, it flies ahead. The canoe body is
light; the pandanus streamers are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131"
href="#pb131" name="pb131">131</a>]</span>aflutter; the prow skims the
waves; the ornamental boards leap, like dolphins; the <i lang=
"kij">tabuyo</i> (small prow-board) breaks the waves; the <i lang=
"kij">lagim&rsquo;</i> (transversal prow-board) breaks the waves. Thou
sleepest in the mountain, thou sleepest in Kuyawa Island. We shall
kindle a small fire of lalang grass, we shall burn aromatic herbs
(i.e., at our destination in the mountains)! Whether new or old, thou
goest ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the exordium of the formula. Then comes a very long middle
part, in a form very characteristic of Trobriand magic. This form
resembles a litany, in so far as a key word or expression is repeated
many times with a series of complementary words and expressions. Then
the first key word is replaced by another, which in its turn, is
repeated with the same series of expressions; then comes another key
word, and so on. We have thus two series of words; each term of the
first is repeated over and over again, with all terms of the second,
and in this manner, with a limited number of words, a spell is very
much lengthened out, since its length is the product of the length of
both series. In shorter spells, there may be only one key word, and in
fact, this is the more usual type. In this spell, the first series
consists of nouns denoting different parts of the canoe; the second are
verbs, such as: to cut, to fly, to speed, to cleave a fleet of other
canoes, to disappear, to skim over the waves. Thus the litany runs in
such a fashion: &ldquo;The tip of my canoe starts, the tip of my canoe
flies, the tip of my canoe speeds, etc., etc.&rdquo; After the long
litany has been chanted, the magician repeats the exordium, and
finishes it off with the conventional onomatopoetic word <i lang=
"kij">saydididi</i>&mdash;which is meant to imitate the flying of the
witches.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>After the recital of this long spell over the herbs and blade of his
adze, the magician wraps up the dry banana leaf, thus imprisoning the
magical virtue of the spell round the blade, and with this, he strikes
and cuts through the <i lang="kij">duku</i> (the creeper used for the
pulling of the canoes.)</p>
<p>With this, the magic is not over yet, for on the same evening, when
the canoe is put on transversal logs (<i lang="kij">nigakulu</i>),
another rite has to be carried out. Some herbs are placed on the
transversals between them and the body of the big canoe log. Over these
herbs, again, another spell has to be uttered. In order not to overload
this account with magical texts, I shall not adduce this spell in
detail. Its wording also plainly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132"
href="#pb132" name="pb132">132</a>]</span>indicates that it is speed
magic, and it is a short formula running on directly, without
cross-repetitions.</p>
<p>After that, for some days, the outside of the canoe body is worked.
Its two ends must be cut into tapering shape, and the bottom evened and
smoothed. After that is done, the canoe has to be turned over, this
time into its natural position, bottom down, and what is to be the
opening, upwards. Before the scooping out begins, another formula has
to be recited over the <i lang="kij">kavilali</i>, a special <i lang=
"kij">ligogu</i> (adze), used for scooping out, which is inserted into
a handle with a moveable part, which then allows the cutting to be done
at varying angles to the plane of striking.</p>
<p>The rite stands in close connection to the myth of the flying canoe,
localised in Kudayuri, a place in the Island of Kitava, and many
allusions are made to this myth.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e4944src"
href="#xd26e4944" name="xd26e4944src">2</a> After a short exordium,
containing untranslatable magical words, and geographical references,
the spell runs:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Ligogu Spell.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;I shall take hold of an adze, I shall strike! I

(between the islands of Tewara and Uwama) you will break the promontory
of Saramwa (near Dobu), pierce the passage of Loma (in Dawson Straits),
die away in the distance, die away with the wind, fade away with the
mist, vanish away. Break through your seaweeds (i.e., on coming against
the shore). Put on your wreath (probably an allusion to the seaweeds),
make your bed in the sand. I turn round, I see the Vakuta men, the
Kitava men behind me; my sea, the sea of Pilolu (i.e., the sea between
the Trobriands and the Amphletts); to-day the Kudayuri men will burn
their fires (i.e., on the shores of Dobu). Bind your grass skirt
together, O canoe&rdquo; (here the personal name of the canoe is
mentioned), &ldquo;fly!&rdquo; The last phrase contains an implicit
hint that the canoe partakes of the nature of a flying witch, as it
should, according to the Kudayuri myth.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>After this, the canoe-builder proceeds to scoop out the log. This is
a long task, and a heavy one, and one which requires a good deal of
skill, especially towards the end, when the walls of the dug-out have
to be made sufficiently thin, and when <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb133" href="#pb133" name="pb133">133</a>]</span>the wood has to be
taken off evenly over the whole surface. Thus, although at the
beginning the canoe carpenter is usually helped by a few men&mdash;his
sons or brothers or nephews who in assisting him also learn the
trade&mdash;towards the end he has to do the work single-handed. It,
therefore, always happens that this stage takes a very long time. Often
the canoe will lie for weeks, untouched, covered with palm leaves
against the sun, and filled with some water to prevent drying and
cracking (see <a href="#pl25">Plate XXV</a>). Then the carpenter will
set to work for a few days, and pause again. In almost all villages,
the canoe is put up in the central place, or before the builder&rsquo;s
hut. In some of the Eastern villages, the scooping out is done on the
sea beach, to avoid pulling the heavy log to and from the village.</p>
<p>Parallel with the process of hollowing out, the other parts of the
canoe are made ready to be pieced together. Four broad and long planks
form the gunwale; L-shaped pieces of wood are cut into ribs; long poles
are prepared for longitudinal support of the ribs, and for platform
rafters; short poles are made ready as transversals of the platform and
main supports of the outrigging; small sticks to connect the float with
the transversals; finally, the float itself, a long, bulky log. These
are the main, constituent parts of a canoe, to be made by the builder.
The four carved boards are also made by him if he knows how to carve,
otherwise another expert has to do this part of the work (see <a href=
"#pl26">Plate XXVI</a>).</p>
<p>When all the parts are ready, another magical rite has to be
performed. It is called &ldquo;<i lang="kij">kapitunela nanola
waga</i>&rdquo;: &ldquo;the cutting off of the canoe&rsquo;s
mind,&rdquo; an expression which denotes <i>a change of mind</i>, a
<i>final determination</i>. In this case, the canoe makes up its mind
to run quickly. The formula is short, contains at the beginning a few
obscure words, and then a few geographical references to some places in
the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux Archipelago. It is recited over a few drops
of coco-nut oil, which is then wrapped up in a small bundle. The same
spell is then again spoken over the <i lang="kij">ligogu</i> blade,
round which a piece of dry banana has been wrapped in the manner
described above. The canoe is turned bottom up, the bundle with
coco-nut oil placed on it and struck with the adze. With this the canoe
is ready to be pieced together, and the first stage of its construction
is over. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href="#pb134" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As has been said above, the two stages differ from one
another in the nature of work done and in their sociological and
ceremonial setting. So far, we have seen only a few men engaged in
cutting the tree and scooping it out and then preparing the various
parts of the canoe. Industriously, but slowly and deliberately, with
many pauses, they toil over their work, sitting on the brown, trodden
soil of the village in front of the huts, or scooping the canoe in the
central place. The first part of the task, the felling of the tree,
took us to the tall jungle and intricate undergrowth, climbing and
festooned around the fantastic shapes of coral rocks.</p>
<p>Now, with the second stage, the scene shifts to the clean,
snow-white sand of a coral beach, where hundreds of natives in festive
array crowd around the freshly scraped body of the canoe. The carved
boards, painted in black, white and red, the green fringe of palms and
jungle trees, the blue of the sea&mdash;all lend colour to the vivid
and lively scene. Thus I saw the building of a canoe done on the East
shore of the Trobriands, and in this setting I remember it. In
Sinaketa, instead of the blue, open sea, breaking in a belt of white
foam outside on the fringing reef and coming in limpid waves to the
beach, there are the dull, muddy browns and greens of the Lagoon,
playing into pure emerald tints where the clean sandy bottom
begins.</p>
<p>Into one of these two scenes, we must now imagine the dug-out
transported from the village, after all is ready, and after the summons
of the chief or headman has gone round the neighbouring villages. In
the case of a big chief, several hundreds of natives will assemble to
help, or to gaze on the performance. When a small community with a
second-rate headman construct their canoe, only a few dozen people will
come, the relatives-in-law of the headman and of other notables, and
their close friends.</p>
<p>After the body of the canoe and all the accessories have been placed
in readiness, the proceedings are opened by a magical rite, called
<i lang="kij">Katuliliva tabuyo</i>. This rite belongs to the Kula
magic, for which the natives have a special expression; they call it
<i lang="kij">mwasila</i>. It is connected with the inserting of the
ornamental prow-boards into their grooves at both ends of the canoe.
These ornamental parts of the canoe are put in first of all, and this
is done ceremonially. A few sprigs of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb135" href="#pb135" name="pb135">135</a>]</span>mint plant are
inserted under the boards, as they are put in, and the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> (owner of the canoe) hammers the boards in by means
of a special stone imported from Dobu, and ritually repeats a formula
of the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> magic. The mint plant (<i lang=
"kij">sulumwoya</i>) plays an important part in the <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i> (Kula magic) as well as in love spells, and in the
magic of beauty. Whenever a substance is to be medicated for the
purpose of charming, seducing, or persuading, as a rule <i lang=
"kij">sulumwoya</i> is used. This plant figures also in several myths,
where it plays a similar part, the mythical hero always conquering the
foe or winning a woman by the use of the <i lang=
"kij">sulumwoya</i>.</p>
<p>I shall not adduce the magical formul&aelig; in this account, with
the exception of the most important one. Even a short summary of each
of them would obstruct the narrative, and it would blur completely the
outline of the consecutive account of the various activities. The
various complexities of the magical ritual and of the formul&aelig;
will be set forth in <a href="#ch17">Chapter XVII</a>. It may be
mentioned here, however, that not only are there several types of magic
performed during canoe building, such as the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i>
(Kula magic), the canoe speed magic, exorcisms against evil magic, and
exorcism of the <i lang="kij">tokway</i>, but within each of these
types, there are different systems of magic, each with its own
mythological basis, each localised in a different district, and each
having of course different formul&aelig; and slightly different
rites.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5035src" href="#xd26e5035" name=
"xd26e5035src">3</a></p>
<p>After the prow-boards are put in, and before the next bit of
technical work is done, another magical rite has to be performed. The
body of the canoe, now bright with the three-coloured boards, is pushed
into the water. A handful of leaves, of a shrub called <i lang=
"kij">bobi&rsquo;u</i>, is charmed by the owner or by the builder, and
the body of the canoe is washed in sea water with the leaves. All the
men participate in the washing, and this rite is intended to make the
canoe fast, by removing the traces of any evil influence, which might
still have remained, in spite of the previous magic, performed on the
<i lang="kij">waga</i>. After the <i lang="kij">waga</i> has been
rubbed and washed, it is pulled ashore again and placed on the skid
logs.</p>
<p>Now the natives proceed to the main and most important constructive
part of their work; this consists of the erection of the gunwale planks
at the sides of the dug-out log, so as to <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb136" href="#pb136" name="pb136">136</a>]</span>form the deep and
wide well of the built-up canoe. They are kept in position by an
internal framework of some twelve to twenty pairs of ribs, and all of
this is lashed together with a special creeper called <i lang=
"kij">wayugo</i>, and the holes and interstices are caulked with a
resinous substance.</p>
<p>I cannot enter here into details of building, though from the
technological point of view, this is the most interesting phase,
showing us the native at grips with real problems of construction. He
has a whole array of component parts, and he must make them fit
together with a considerable degree of precision, and that without
having any exact means of measurement. By a rough appreciation based on
long experience and great skill, he estimates the relative shapes and
sizes of the planks, the angles and dimensions of the ribs, and the
lengths of the various poles. Then, in shaping them out, the builder
tests and fits them in a preliminary manner as work goes on, and as a
rule the result is good. But now, when all these component parts have
to be pieced finally together, it nearly always happens that some bit
or other fails to fit properly with the rest. These details have to be
adjusted, a bit taken off the body of the canoe, a plank or pole
shortened, or even a piece added. The natives have a very efficient way
of lashing on a whole bit of a plank, if this proves too short, or if,
by some accident, it breaks at the end. After all has been finally
fitted, and made to tally, the framework of ribs is put into the canoe
(see <a href="#pl27">Plate XXVII</a>), and the natives proceed to lash
them to the body of the dug-out, and to the two longitudinal poles to
which the ribs are threaded.</p>
<p>And now a few words must be said about the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i>,
the lashing creeper. Only one species of creeper is used for the
lashing of boats, and it is of the utmost importance that this creeper
should be sound and strong. It is this alone that maintains the
cohesion of the various parts, and in rough weather, very much depends
on how the lashings will stand the strain. The other parts of the
canoe&mdash;the outrigger poles&mdash;can be more easily tested, and as
they are made of strong, elastic wood, they usually stand any weather
quite well. Thus the element of danger and uncertainty in a canoe is
due mainly to the creeper. No wonder, therefore, that the magic of the
creeper is considered as one of the most important ritual items in
canoe-building. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137"
name="pb137">137</a>]</span></p>
<p>In fact, <i lang="kij">wayugo</i>, the name of that creeper species,
is also used as a general term for canoe magic. When a man has the
reputation of building or owning a good and fast canoe, the usual way
of explaining it is to say that he has, or knows &ldquo;a good <i lang=
"kij">wayugo</i>.&rdquo; For, as in all other magic, there are several
types of <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> spells. The ritual is always
practically the same: five coils of the creeper are, on the previous
day, placed on a large wooden dish and chanted over in the
owner&rsquo;s hut by himself. Only exceptionally can this magic be done
by the builder. Next day they are brought to the beach ceremonially on
the wooden plate. In one of the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> systems, there
is an additional rite, in which the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> (canoe
owner) takes a piece of the creeper, inserts it into one of the holes
pierced in the rim of the dug-out for the lashing, and pulling it to
and fro, recites once more the spell.</p>
<p>In consideration of the importance of this magic, the formula will
be here adduced in full. It consists of an exordium (<i lang=
"kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>), a double main part (<i lang="kij">tapwana</i>),
and a concluding period (<i lang="kij">dogina</i>).<a class="noteref"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i> he first repeats
&ldquo;Sacred (or ritual) eating of fish, sacred inside,&rdquo; thus
alluding to a belief that the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> has in
connection with this magic to partake ritually of baked fish. Then come
the words&mdash;&ldquo;Flutter, betel plant, leaving behind,&rdquo; all
associated with leading ideas of canoe magic&mdash;the flutter of
pandanus streamers; the <span class="corr" id="xd26e5119" title=
"Source: betel nut">betel-nut</span>, which the ancestral spirits in
other rites are invited to partake of; the speed by which all comrades
will be left behind!</p>
<p>A list of ancestral names follows. Two of them, probably mythical
personages, have significative names; &ldquo;Stormy sea&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Foaming.&rdquo; Then the <i lang="kij">baloma</i> (spirits) of
these ancestors are asked to sit on the canoe slips and to chew betel,
and they are invoked to take the pandanus streamer of the
Kudayuri&mdash;a place in Kitava, where the flying canoe magic
originated&mdash;and plant it on top of Teula or Tewara, the small
island off the East coast of Fergusson.</p>
<p>The magician after that chants: &ldquo;I shall turn, I shall turn
towards you, O men of Kitava, you remain behind <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name="pb138">138</a>]</span>on
the To&rsquo;uru beach (in the Lagoon of Vakuta). Before you lies the
sea arm of Pilolu. To-day, they kindle the festive fire of the
Kudayuri, thou, O my boat&rdquo; (here the personal name of the boat is
uttered), &ldquo;bind thy skirts together and fly!&rdquo; In this
passage&mdash;which is almost identical with one in the previously
quoted <i lang="kij">Ligogu</i> spell&mdash;there is a direct allusion
to the Kudayuri myth, and to the custom of festive fires. Again the
canoe is addressed as a woman who has to bind her grass petticoat
together during her flight, a reference to the belief that a flying
witch binds her skirts when starting into the air and to the tradition
that this myth originates from Na&rsquo;ukuwakula, one of the flying
Kudayuri sisters. The following main part continues with this mythical
allusion: Na&rsquo;ukuwakula flew from Kitava through Sinaketa and
Kayleula to Simsim, where she settled down and transmitted the magic to
her progeny. In this spell the three places: Kuyawa (a creek and
hillock near Sinaketa), Dikutuwa (a rock near Kayleula), and La&rsquo;u
(a cleft rock in the sea near Simsim, in the Lousan&ccedil;ay Islands)
are the leading words of the <i lang="kij">tapwana</i>.</p>
<p>The last sentence of the first part, forming a transition into the
<i lang="kij">tapwana</i>, runs as follows: &ldquo;I shall grasp the
handle of the adze, I shall grip all the component parts of the
canoe&rdquo;&mdash;perhaps another allusion to the mythical
construction of the Kudayuri canoe (comp. <a href="#div12.4">Chap. XII,
Div. IV</a>)&mdash;&ldquo;I shall fly on the top of Kuyawa, I shall
disappear; dissolve in mist, in smoke; become like a wind eddy, become
alone&mdash;on top of Kuyawa.&rdquo; The same words are then repeated,
substituting for Kuyawa the two other above-mentioned spots, one after
the other, and thus retracing the flight of Na&rsquo;ukuwakula.</p>
<p>Then the magician returns to the beginning and recites the spell
over again up to the phrase: &ldquo;bind thy skirt together and
fly,&rdquo; which is followed this time by a second <i lang=
"kij">tapwana</i>: &ldquo;I shall outdistance all my comrades with the
bottom of my canoe; I shall out-distance all my comrades with the
prow-board of my canoe, etc., etc.,&rdquo; repeating the prophetic
boast with all the parts of the canoe, as is usual in the middle part
of magical spells.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="kij">dogina</i>, the last part, the magician
addresses the <i lang="kij">waga</i> in mythological terms, with
allusions to the Kudayuri myth, and adds: &ldquo;Canoe thou art a
ghost, thou art like a wind eddy; vanish, O my canoe, fly; break
through your sea-passage of Kadimwatu, cleave through the promontory of
Saramwa, pass through Loma; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=

<p class="figureHead">Rolls of Dried Pandanus Leaf</p>
<p>This is the material of which the sail is made. The <i lang=
"kij">bisila</i> (pandanus streamer) is made of a softer variety of
pandanus leaf, bleached at a fire.</p>
</div>
<p>After the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> has been ritually brought in, the
lashing of the canoe begins. First of all the ribs are lashed into
position then the planks, and with this the body of the canoe is ready.
This takes a varying time, according to the number of people at work,
and to the amount of tallying and adjusting to be done at the final
fitting. Sometimes one whole day&rsquo;s work is spent on this stage,
and the next piece of work, the construction of the outrigger, has to
be postponed to another day. This is the next stage, and there is no
magic to punctuate the course of technical activities. The big, solid
log is put alongside the canoe, and a number of short, pointed sticks
are driven into it. The sticks are put in crossways on the top of the
float (<i lang="kij">lamina</i>). Then the tops of these sticks are
again attached to a number of horizontal poles, which have to be thrust
through one side of the canoe-body, and attached to the other. All this
naturally requires again adjusting and fitting. When these sticks and
poles are bound together, there results a strong yet elastic frame, in
which the canoe and the float are held together in parallel positions,
and across them transversely there run the several horizontal poles
which keep them together. Next, these poles are bridged over by many
longitudinal sticks lashed together, and thus a platform is made
between the edge of the canoe and the tops of the float sticks.</p>
<p>When that is done, the whole frame of the canoe is ready, and there
remains only to caulk the holes and interstices. The caulking substance
is prepared in the hut of the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>, and a spell
is recited over it on the evening before the work is begun. Then again,
the whole community turn out and do the work in one day&rsquo;s
sitting.</p>
<p>The canoe is now ready for the sea, except for the painting, Which
is only for ornamentation. Three more magical rites have to be
performed, however, before it is painted and then launched. All three
refer directly to the canoe, and aim at giving it speed. At the same
time all three are exorcisms against evil influences, resulting from
various defilements or broken taboos, which possibly might have
desecrated the <i lang="kij">waga</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb140" href="#pb140" name="pb140">140</a>]</span>The first is called
<i lang="kij">Vakasulu</i>, which means something like &ldquo;ritual
cooking&rdquo; of the canoe. The <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> has to
prepare a real witches&rsquo; cauldron of all sorts of things, which
afterwards are burnt under the bottom of the canoe, and the smoke is
supposed to exercise a speed-giving and cleansing influence. The
ingredients are: the wings of a bat, the nest of a very small bird
called <i lang="kij">posisiku</i>, some dried bracken leaves, a bit of
cotton fluff, and some lalang grass. All the substances are associated
with flying and lightness. The wood used for kindling the fire is that
of the light-timbered mimosa tree (<i lang="kij">liga</i>). The twigs
have to be obtained by throwing at the tree a piece of wood (never a
stone), and when the broken-off twig falls, it must be caught in the
hand, and not allowed to touch the ground.</p>
<p>The second rite, called <i lang="kij">Vaguri</i>, is an exorcism
only, and it consists of charming a stick, and then knocking the body
of the canoe all over with it. This <span class="corr" id="xd26e5247"
title="Source: expells">expels</span> the evil witchery (<i lang=
"kij">bulubwalata</i>), which it is only wise to suspect has been cast
by some envious rivals, or persons jealous of the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i>.</p>
<p>Finally, the third of these rites, the <i lang="kij">Kaytapena
waga</i>, consists in medicating a torch of coco-leaf with the
appropriate spell, and fumigating with it the inside of the canoe. This
gives speed and once more cleanses the canoe.</p>
<p>After another sitting of a few days, the whole outside of the canoe
is painted in three colours. Over each of them a special spell is
chanted again, the most important one over the black colour. This is
never omitted, while the red and white spells are optional. In the rite
of the black colour, again, a whole mixture of <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5263" title="Source: sunstances">substances</span> is
used&mdash;a dry bracken leaf, grass, and a <i lang="kij">posisiku</i>
nest&mdash;all this is charred with some coco-nut husk, and the first
strokes of the black paint are made with the mixture. The rest is
painted with a watery mixture of charred coco-nut. For red colour, a
sort of ochre, imported from the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux Islands, is
used; the white one is made of a chalky earth, found in certain parts
of the sea shore.</p>
<p>Sail-making is done on another day, usually in the village, by
communal labour, and, with a number of people helping, the tedious and
complicated work is performed in a relatively short time. The
triangular outline of the sail is first pegged out on the ground, as a
rule the old sail being used as a pattern. After this is done, tapes of
dried pandanus leaf (see Plates <a href="#pl28">XXVIII</a>, <a href=
"#pl29">XXIX</a>) are stretched on the ground and first fixed
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name=
"pb141">141</a>]</span>along the borders of the sail. Then, starting at
the apex of the triangle, the sail-makers put tapes radiating towards
the base, sewing them together with awls of flying fox bone, and using
as thread narrow strips of specially toughened pandanus leaf. Two
layers of tapes are sewn one on top of the other to make a solid
fabric.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The canoe is now quite ready to be launched. But
before we go on to an account of the ceremonial launching and the
associated festivities, one or two general remarks must be made
retrospectively about the proceedings just described.</p>
<p>The whole of the first stage of canoe-building, that is, the cutting
of the tree, the scooping out of the log, and the preparation of the
other component parts, with all their associated magic, is done only
when a new canoe is built.</p>
<p>But the second stage has to be performed over all the canoes before
every great overseas Kula expedition. On such an occasion, all the
canoes have to be re-lashed, re-caulked, and re-painted. This obviously
requires that they should all be taken to pieces and then lashed,
caulked and painted exactly as is done with a new canoe. All the magic
incidental to these three processes is then performed, in its due
order, over the renovated canoe. So that we can say about the second
stage of canoe-building that not only is it always performed in
association with the Kula, but that no big expedition ever takes place
without it.</p>
<p>We have had a description of the magical rites, and the ideas which
are implied in every one of them have been specified. But there are one
or two more general characteristics which must be mentioned here.
First, there is what could be called the &ldquo;ceremonial
dimension&rdquo; of magical rites. That is, how far is the performance
of the rite attended by the members of the community, if at all; and if
so, do they actively take part in it, or do they simply pay keen
attention and behave as an interested audience; or, though being
present, do they pay little heed and show only small interest?</p>
<p>In the first stage of canoe-building, the rites are performed by the
magician himself, with only a few helpers in attendance. The general
village public do not feel sufficiently interested and attracted to
assist, nor are they bound by custom to do so. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href="#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>The
general character of these rites is more like the performance of a
technicality of work than of a ceremony. The preparing of herbs for the
<i lang="kij">ligogu</i> magic, for instance, and the charming it over,
is carried out in a matter-of-fact, businesslike manner, and nothing in
the <span class="corr" id="xd26e5297" title=
"Source: beaviour">behaviour</span> of the magician and those casually
grouped around him would indicate that anything specially interesting
in the routine work is happening.</p>
<p>The rites of the second stage are <i lang="la">ipso facto</i>
attended by all those who help in piecing together and lashing, but on
the whole those present have no special task assigned to them in the
performance of these rites. As to the attention and behaviour during
the performance of the magic, much depends of course on whether the
magician officiating is a chief of great importance or someone of low
rank. A certain decorum and even silence would be observed in any case.
But many of those present would turn aside and go away, if they wanted
to do so. The magician does not produce the impression of an
officiating high priest performing a solemn ceremony, but rather of a
specialised workman doing a particularly important piece of work. It
must be remembered that all the rites are simple, and the chanting of
the spells in public is done in a low voice, and quickly, without any
specially effective vocal production. Again, the caulking and the
<i lang="kij">wayugo</i> rites are, in some types of magic at least,
performed in the magician&rsquo;s hut, without any attendance whatever,
and so is that of the black paint.</p>
<p>Another point of general importance is what could be called the
stringency of magic rites. In canoe magic, for instance, the expulsion
of the <i lang="kij">tokway</i>, the ritual cutting of the pulling
rope, the magic of the adze (<i lang="kij">ligogu</i>), that of the
lashing creeper (<i lang="kij">wayugo</i>), of the caulking, and of the
black paint can never be omitted. Whereas the other rites are optional,
though as a rule some of them are performed. But even those which are
considered indispensable do not all occupy the same place of importance
in native mythology and in native ideas, which is clearly expressed in
the behaviour of the natives and their manner of speaking of them.
Thus, the general term for canoe magic is either <i lang=
"kij">wayugo</i> or <i lang="kij">ligogu</i>, from which we can see
that these two spells are considered the most important. A man will
speak about his <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> being better than that of the
other, or of having learnt his <i lang="kij">ligogu</i> from his
father. Again, as we shall see in the canoe myth, both these rites are
explicitly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143" name=
"pb143">143</a>]</span>mentioned there. Although the expulsion of the
<i lang="kij">tokway</i> is always done, it is definitely recognised by
the natives as being of lesser importance. So are also the magic of
caulking and of the black paint.</p>
<p>A less general point, of great interest, however, is that of evil
magic (<i lang="kij">bulubwalata</i>) and of broken taboos. I had to
mention several exorcisms against those influences, and something must
be said about them here. The term <i lang="kij">bulubwalata</i> covers
all forms of evil magic or witchery. There is that which, directed
against pigs, makes them run away from their owners into the bush;
there is <i lang="kij">bulubwalata</i> for alienating the affections of
a wife or sweetheart; there is evil magic against gardens,
and&mdash;perhaps the most dreaded one&mdash;evil magic against rain,
producing drought and famine. The evil magic against canoes, making
them slow, heavy, and unseaworthy, is also much feared. Many men
profess to know it, but it is very difficult for the Ethnographer to
obtain a formula, and I succeeded only in taking down one. It is always
supposed to be practised by canoe-owners upon the craft which they
regard as dangerous rivals of their own.</p>
<p>There are many taboos referring to an already constructed canoe, and
we shall meet with them later when speaking about sailing and handling
the canoe. But before that stage is reached, any defilement with any
unclean substance of the log out of which the canoe is scooped, would
make it slow and bad; or if anybody were to walk over a canoe log or
stand on it there would be the same evil result.</p>
<p>One more point must be mentioned here. As we have seen, the first
magical rite, of the second stage of construction, is performed over
the prow-boards. The question obtrudes itself as to whether the designs
on these boards have any magical meaning. It must be clearly understood
that any guesswork or speculations about origins must be rigidly
excluded from ethnographic field work like this. For a sociologically
empirical answer, the Ethnographer must look to two classes of facts.
First of all, he may directly question the natives as to whether the
prow-boards themselves or any of the motives upon them are done for
magical purposes. Whether he questions the average man, or even the
specialist in canoe magic and carving, to this he will always receive
in Kiriwina a negative answer. He can then enquire whether in the
magical <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>ritual for formul&aelig; there are no references
to the prow-boards, or to any of the decorative motives on them. Here
also, the evidence on the whole is negative. In one spell perhaps, and
that belonging not to canoe but to the Kula magic (comp. below,
<a href="#div13.2">Chap. XIII, Div. II</a>, the Kayikuna Tabuyo spell),
there can be found an allusion to the prow-boards, but only to the term
describing them in general, and not to any special decorative motive.
Thus the only association between canoe decoration and canoe magic
consists in the fact that two magical rites are performed over them,
one mentioned already, and the other to be mentioned at the beginning
of the next chapter.</p>
<p>The description of canoe-building, in fact, all the data given in
this chapter, refer only to one of the two types of sea-going canoe to
be found in the Kula district. For the natives of the Eastern half of
the ring use craft bigger, and in certain respects better, than the
<i lang="kij">masawa</i>. The main difference between the Eastern and
Western type consists in the fact that the bigger canoes have a higher
gunwale or side, and consequently a greater carrying capacity, and they
can be immersed deeper. The larger water board offers more resistance
against making leeway, and this allows the canoes to be sailed closer
to the wind. Consequently, the Eastern canoes can beat, and these
natives are therefore much more independent of the direction of the
wind in their sailings. With this is connected the position of the
mast, which in this type is stepped in the middle, and it is also
permanently fixed, and is not taken down every time after sailing. It
obviously, therefore, need not be changed in its position every time
the canoe goes on another tack.</p>
<p>I have not seen the construction of a <i lang="kij">nagega</i>, as
these canoes are called, but I think that it is technically a much more
difficult task than the building of a <i lang="kij">masawa</i>. I was
told that both magic and ceremonial of construction are very much the
same in the building of both canoes.</p>
<p>The <i lang="kij">nagega</i>, that is the larger and more seaworthy
type, is used on the section of the Kula ring beginning in Gawa and
ending in Tubetube. It is also used in certain parts of the Massim
district, which lie outside the Kula ring, such as the Island of
Sud-Est, and surrounding smaller islands, and it is used among the
Southern Massim of the mainland. But though its use is very widely
spread, its manufacture is confined <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb145" href="#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>to only a few places.
The most important centres of <i lang="kij">nagega</i> building are
Gawa, a few villages on Woodlark Islands, the island of Panayati, and
perhaps one or two places on Misima. From there, the canoes are traded
all over the district, and indeed this is one of the most important
forms of trade in this part of the world. The <i lang="kij">masawa</i>
canoes are used and manufactured in the district of Dobu, in the
Amphletts, in the Trobriands, in Kitava and Iwa.</p>
<p>One point of great importance in the relation of these two forms of
canoe is that one of them has, within the last two generations, been
expanding at the expense of the other. According to reliable
information, gathered at several points in the Trobriands and the
Amphletts, the <i lang="kij">nagega</i> type, that is the heavier, more
seaworthy and better-sailing canoe, was driven out some time ago from
the Amphletts and Trobriands. The <i lang="kij">masawa</i>, in many
respects inferior, but less difficult to build, and swifter, has
supplanted the bigger type. In olden days, that is, about two or three
generations ago, the <i lang="kij">nagega</i> was used exclusively in
Iwa, Kitava, Kiriwina, Vakuta, and Sinaketa, while the Amphlettans and
the natives of Kayleula would usually use the <i lang="kij">nagega</i>,
though sometimes they would sail in <i lang="kij">masawa</i> canoes.
Dobu was the real home and headquarters of the <i lang=
"kij">masawa</i>. When the shifting began, and when it was completed, I
could not ascertain. But the fact is that nowadays even the villages of
Kitava and Iwa manufacture the smaller <i lang="kij">masawa</i> canoe.
Thus, one of the most important cultural items is spreading from South
to North. There is, however, one point on which I could not obtain
definite information: that is, whether in the Trobriands the <i lang=
"kij">nagega</i> in olden days was imported from Kitava, or whether it
was manufactured locally by imported craftsmen (as is done even
nowadays in Kiriwina at times), or whether the Trobrianders themselves
knew how to make the big canoes. There is no doubt, however, that in
olden days, the natives of Kitava and Iwa used themselves to make the
<i lang="kij">nagega</i> canoes. The Kudayuri myth (see <a href=
"#ch12">Chapter XII</a>), and the connected magic, refer to this type
of canoe. Thus in this district at any rate, and probably in the
Trobriands and Amphletts as well, not only the use, but also the
manufacture of the bigger canoe has been superseded by that of the
smaller one, the <i lang="kij">masawa</i>, now found in all these
parts. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The canoe, painted and decorated, stands now ready to
be launched, a source of pride to the owners and to the makers, and an
object of admiration to the other beholders. A new sailing craft is not
only another utility created; it is more: it is a new entity sprung
into being, something with which the future destinies of the sailors
will be bound up, and on which they will depend. There can be no doubt
that this sentiment is also felt by the natives and expressed in their
customs and behaviour. The canoe receives a personal name, it becomes
an object of intense interest to the whole district. Its qualities,
points of beauty, and of probable perfection or faultiness are
canvassed round the fires at night. The owner and his kinsmen and
fellow villagers will speak of it with the usual boasting and
exaggerations, and the others will all be very keen to see it, and to
watch its performances. Thus the institution of ceremonial launching is
not a mere formality prescribed by custom; it corresponds to the
psychological needs of the community, it rouses a great interest, and
is very well attended even when the canoe belongs to a small community.
When a big chief&rsquo;s canoe is launched, whether that of
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5432" title=
"Source: Kasanai">Kasana&rsquo;i</span> or Omarakana, Olivilevi or
Sinaketa, up to a thousand natives will assemble on the beach.</p>
<p>This festive and public display of a finished canoe, with its full
paint and ornament, is not only in harmony with the natives&rsquo;
sentiments towards a new sailing craft; it also agrees with the way
they treat in general the results of their economic activities. Whether
in gardening or in fishing, in the building of houses or in industrial
achievements, there is a tendency to display the products, to arrange
them, and even adorn at least certain classes of them, so as to produce
a big, &aelig;sthetic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href=
"#pb147" name="pb147">147</a>]</span>effect. In fishing, there are only
traces of this tendency, but in gardening, it assumes very great
proportions, and the handling, arranging and display of garden produce
is one of the most characteristic features of their tribal life, and it
takes up much time and work.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e5439src" href=
"#xd26e5439" name="xd26e5439src">1</a></p>
<p>Soon after the painting and adorning of the canoe, a date is fixed
for the ceremonial launching and trial run, the <i lang=
"kij">tasasoria</i> festivities, as they are called. Word is passed to
the chiefs and headmen of the neighbouring villages. Those of them who
own canoes and who belong to the same Kula community have always to
come with their canoes and take part in a sort of regatta held on the
occasion. As the new canoe is always constructed in connection with a
Kula expedition, and as the other canoes of the same Kula community
have to be either done up or replaced, it is the rule that on the
<i lang="kij">tasasoria</i> day a whole fleet of brand new or renovated
canoes assemble on the beach, all resplendent in fresh colours and
decoration of cowrie shells and bleached pandanus streamers.</p>
<p>The launching itself is inaugurated with a rite of the <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i> (Kula magic), called <i lang="kij">Kaytalula wadola
waga</i> (&ldquo;staining red of the mouth of the canoe&rdquo;). After
the natives have taken off the plaited coco-nut leaves with which the
canoe is protected against the sun, the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>
chants a spell over some red ochre, and stains both bow and stern of
the canoe. A special cowrie shell, attached to the prow-board (<i lang=
"kij">tabuyo</i>) is stained at each end. After that the canoe is
launched, the villagers pushing it into the water over pieces of wood
transversely placed which act as slips (see <a href="#pl30">Plate
XXX</a>). This is done amidst shouts and ululations, such as are made
on all occasions when some piece of work has to be done in a festive
and ceremonial manner, when, for instance, the harvest is brought in
and given ceremonially by a man to his brother-in-law, or when a gift
of yams or taro is laid down before a fisherman&rsquo;s house by an
inland gardener, or the return gift of fish is made.</p>
<p>Thus the canoe is finally launched after the long series of mingled
work and ceremony, technical effort and magical rite.</p>
<p>After the launching is done, there takes place a feast, or, more
correctly, a distribution of food (<i lang="kij">sagali</i>) under
observation of all sorts of formalities and ritual. Such a distribution
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb148" href="#pb148" name=
"pb148">148</a>]</span>is always made when the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> has not built the canoe himself, and when he
therefore has to repay the cutter of the canoe and his helpers. It also
takes place whenever the canoe of a big chief is launched, in order to
celebrate the occasion, to show off his wealth and generosity, and to
give food to the many people who have been summoned to assist in the
construction.</p>
<p>After the <i lang="kij">sagali</i> (ceremonial distribution of food)
is over, as a rule, in the afternoon, the new canoe is rigged, the mast
is put up, the sail attached, and this and all the other boats make a
trial run. It is not a competitive race in the strict sense of the
word. The chief&rsquo;s canoe, which indeed would as a rule be best and
fastest, in any case always wins the race. If it did not sail fastest,
the others would probably keep back. The trial run is rather a display
of the new canoe, side by side with the others.</p>
<p>In order to give one concrete illustration of the ceremonial
connected with canoe building and launching, it may be well to relate
an actual event. I shall therefore describe the <i lang=
"kij">tasasoria</i>, seen on the beach of Kaulukuba, in February, 1916,
when the new canoe of Kasana&rsquo;i was launched. Eight canoes took
part in the trial run, that is, all the canoes of Kiriwina, which forms
what I have called the &ldquo;Kula community,&rdquo; the social group
who make their Kula expeditions in a body, and who have the same limits
within which they carry on their exchange of valuables.</p>

</div>
<p>The great event which was the cause of the building and renovating
of the canoes, was a Kula expedition planned by To&rsquo;ulawa and his
Kula community. They were to go to the East, to Kitava, to Iwa or Gawa,
perhaps even to Muruwa (Woodlark Island), though with this island the
natives do not carry on the Kula directly. As is usual in such cases,
months before the approximate date of sailing, plans and forecasts were
made, stories of previous voyages were recounted, old men dwelt on
their own reminiscences and reported what they had been told by their
elders of the days when iron was unknown and everyone had to sail to
the East in order to get the green stone quarried in Suloga on Woodlark
Island. And so, as it always happens when future events are talked over
round village fires, imagination outran all bounds of probability; and
the hopes and anticipations grew bigger and bigger. In <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149" name="pb149">149</a>]</span>the
end, everyone really believed his party would go at least to the
Easternmost Marshall Bennetts (Gawa), whereas, as events turned out,
they did not sail beyond Kitava.</p>
<p>For this occasion a new canoe had to be constructed in
Kasana&rsquo;i, and this was done by Ibena himself, the chief of that
village, a man of rank equal to the highest chief (his kinsman, in
fact) but of smaller power. Ibena is a skilled builder as well as a
fair carver, and there is no class of magic in which he does not
profess to be versed. The canoe was built, under his guidance; he
carved the boards himself, he also performed the magic, and he was, of
course, the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>.</p>
<p>In Omarakana, the canoe had to be slightly altered in construction;
it had to be re-lashed and re-painted. To do this To&rsquo;uluwa, the
chief, had summoned a master builder and carver from the island of
Kitava, the same one who a couple of years before, had built this
canoe. Also a new sail had to be made for the Omarakana boat, as the
old one was too small. The ceremony of <i lang="kij">tasasoria</i>
(launching and regatta) ought by rights to have been held on the beach
of Kasana&rsquo;i, but as its sister village, Omarakana, is so much
more important, it took place on Kaulukuba, the sea-shore of the
latter.</p>
<p>As the date approached, the whole district was alive with
preparations, since the coastal villages had to put their canoes in
order, while in the inland communities, new festive dresses and food
had to be made ready. The food was not to be eaten, but to be offered
to the chief for his <i lang="kij">sagali</i> (ceremonial
distribution). Only in Omarakana, the women had to cook for a big
festive repast to be eaten on return from the <i lang=
"kij">tasasoria</i>. In the Trobriands it is always a sign that a
festive event is pending when all the women go in the evening to the
bush to collect plenty of firewood. Next morning, this will be used for
the <i lang="kij">kumkumuli</i>, the baking of food in the ground,
which is one of the forms of cooking used on festive occasions. On the
evening of the <i lang="kij">tasasoria</i> ceremony, people in
Omarakana and Kasana&rsquo;i were also busy with the numerous other
preparations, running to the shore and back, filling baskets with yams
for the <i lang="kij">sagali</i>, getting ready their festive dress and
decorations for the morrow. Festive dress means, for a woman, a new
grass skirt, resplendent in fresh red, white and purple, and for the
man a newly bleached, snow-white pubic leaf, made of the stalk of areca
palm leaf. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span></p>
<p>Early in the morning of the appointed day, the food was packed into
baskets of plaited leaf, the personal apparel on top of it, all covered
as usual with folded mats and conveyed to the beach. The women carried
on their heads the large baskets, shaped like big inverted bells, the
men shouldered a stick with two bag-shaped baskets at each end. Other
men had to carry the oars, paddles, rigging and sail, as these
<span class="corr" id="xd26e5582" title=
"Source: paraphenalia">paraphernalia</span> are always kept in the
village. From one of the villages, one of the large, prismatic
receptacles for food made of sticks was carried by several men right
over the <i lang="kij">raybwag</i> (coral ridge) to be offered to the
chief of Omarakana as a share in the <i lang="kij">sagali</i>. The
whole village was astir, and on its outskirts, through the surrounding
groves, parties from inland could be seen making their way rapidly to
the shore. I left the village with a party of notables at about eight
o&rsquo;clock in the morning. After leaving the grove of fruit and palm
trees which grows especially densely around the village of Omarakana,
we entered between the two walls of green, the usual monotonous
Trobriand road, which passes through the low scrub. Soon, emerging on a
garden space, we could see, beyond a gentle declivity, the rising slope
of the <i lang="kij">raybwag</i>, a mixture of rank vegetation with
monumental boulders of grey coral standing out here and there. Through
this, the path led on, following in an intricate course between small
precipices and towering outcrops, passing huge, ancient ficus trees,
spreading around them their many trunks and aerial roots. At the top of
the ridge, all of a sudden the blue sea shone through the foliage, and
the roar of waves breaking on the reef struck our ears. Soon we found
ourselves among the crowd assembled on the beach, near to the big
boat-shed of Omarakana.</p>
<p>By about nine o&rsquo;clock, everybody was ready on the beach. It
was fully exposed to the Eastern sun, but this was not yet sufficiently
high to drop its light right from above, and thus to produce that
deadly effect of tropical mid-day, where the shadows instead of
modelling out the details, blur every vertical surface and make
everything dull and formless. The beach appeared bright and gaudy, and
the lively brown bodies looked well against the background of green
foliage and white sand. The natives were anointed with coco-nut oil,
and decorated with flowers and facial paint. Large red hibiscus
blossoms were stuck into their hair, and wreaths of the white,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name=
"pb151">151</a>]</span>wonderfully scented <i lang="kij">butia</i>
flowers crowned the dense black mops. There was a good display of ebony
carvings, sticks and lime spoons. There were decorated lime pots, and
such objects of personal adornment as belts of red shell discs or of
small cowrie shells, nose sticks (very rarely used nowadays), and other
articles so well known to everybody from ethnological collections in
museums, and usually called &ldquo;ceremonial,&rdquo; though, as said
above (<a href="#div3.3">Chapter III, Div. III</a>) the description
&ldquo;objects of parade&rdquo; would be much more in agreement with
the correct meaning of the words.</p>
<p>Such popular festivities as the one just being described are the
occasions on which these objects of parade, some of which astonish us
by their artistic perfection, appear in native life. Before I had
opportunities to see savage art in actual display, in its proper,
&ldquo;living&rdquo; setting, there seemed to me always to exist some
incongruity between the artistic finish of such objects and the general
crudity of savage life, a crudity marked precisely on the
&aelig;sthetic side. One imagines greasy, dirty, naked bodies, moppy
hair full of vermin, and other realistic features which make up
one&rsquo;s idea of the &ldquo;savage,&rdquo; and in some respects
reality bears out imagination. As a matter of fact though, the
incongruity does not exist when once one has seen native art actually
displayed in its own setting. A festive mob of natives, with the
wonderful golden-brown colour of their skins brought out by washing and
anointing and set off by the gaudy white, red and black of facial
paint, feathers and ornaments, with their exquisitely carved and
polished ebony objects, with their finely worked lime pots, has a
distinct elegance of its own, without striking one as grotesque or
incongruous in any &aelig;sthetic detail. There is an evident harmony
between their festive mood, the display of colours and forms, and the
manner in which they put on and bear their ornaments.</p>
<p>Those who have come from a distance, and who would spoil their
decorations by the long march, wash with water and anoint themselves
with coco-nut grease immediately before arriving at the scene of
festivities. As a rule the best paint is put on later on, when the
climax of the proceedings approaches. On this occasion, after the
preliminaries (distribution of food, arrival of other canoes) were
over, and when the races were just going to be started, the aristocracy
of Omarakana&mdash;the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb152" href=
"#pb152" name="pb152">152</a>]</span>wives and children of
To&rsquo;uluwa, his relatives and himself&mdash;withdrew behind the
shelters, near the boat shed, and proceeded to put on the red, white
and black of full facial paint. They crushed young betel-nut, mixed it
with lime, and put it on with the pestles of betel mortars; then some
of the aromatic black resin (<i lang="kij">sayaku</i>) and white lime
were applied. As the habit of mirrors is not quite well established yet
in the Trobriands, the painting was done by one person on the face of
another, and great care and patience were displayed on both sides.</p>
<p>The numerous crowd spent the day without taking much
refreshment&mdash;a feature strongly differentiating Kiriwinian
festivities from our ideal of an entertainment or picnic. No cooking
was done, and only a few bananas were eaten here and there, and green
coco-nuts were drunk and eaten. But even these refreshments were
consumed with great frugality.</p>
<p>As always on such occasions, the people collected together in sets,
the visitors from each village forming a group apart. The local natives
kept to their own boat houses, those of Omarakana and Kurokaiwa having
their natural centres on the beach of Kaulukuba. The other visitors
similarly kept together in their position on the beach, according to
their local distribution; thus, men from the Northern villages would
keep to the Northern section of the beach, those from the South would
stick to that point of the compass, so that villages which were
neighbours in reality would also be side by side on the shore. There
was no mingling in the crowd, and individuals would not walk about from
one group to another. The aristocrats, out of personal dignity, humble
folk because of a modesty imposed by custom, would keep in their
places. To&rsquo;uluwa sat practically <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e5618" title="Not in source">still</span> during the whole
performance, on the platform erected for this purpose, except when he
went over to his boat, to trim it for the race.</p>
<p>The boat shed of Omarakana, round which the chief, his family and
the other villagers were grouped, was the centre of all the
proceedings. Under one of the palms, a fairly high platform was put up
to accommodate To&rsquo;uluwa. In a row in front of the sheds and
shelters, there stood the prismatic food receptacles (<i lang=
"kij">pwata&rsquo;i</i>). They had been erected by the inhabitants of
Omarakana and Kasana&rsquo;i, on the previous day, and partially filled
with yams. The rest had to be supplied <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb153" href="#pb153" name="pb153">153</a>]</span>by people from the
other villages, on the day of the boat races. As the natives came to
the beach on that day, village after village, they brought their
contribution, and before settling down on their particular spot on the
shore, they paid a visit to the chief and offered him their tributes.
These would be put into one of the <i lang="kij">pwata&rsquo;i</i>. All
the villages did not contribute their share, but the majority did,
though some of them brought only a few baskets. One of the villages
brought one complete <i lang="kij">pwata&rsquo;i</i>, filled with yams,
and offered the whole to the chief.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the eight canoes arrived, including that of
Kasana&rsquo;i, which had been ceremonially launched that morning with
the accompanying magical rite, on its own beach about half a mile away.
The canoe of Omarakana had also been launched on this morning (<a href=
"#pl30">Plate XXX</a>), and the same rite performed over it. It ought
to have been done by To&rsquo;uluwa, the chief. As he, however, is
quite incapable of remembering magical spells&mdash;in fact, he never
does any of the magic which his rank and office impose on him&mdash;the
rite was performed on this occasion by one of his kinsmen. This is a
typical case of a rule very stringently formulated by all informants
when you ask about it, yet in reality often observed with laxity. If
you inquire directly, everyone will tell you that this rite, as all
others of the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> (Kula magic) has to be done by
the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>. But every time when he ought to perform
it, To&rsquo;uluwa will find some excuse, and delegate it to
another.</p>
<p>When all the canoes were present, as well as all the important
villages, at about eleven o&rsquo;clock <span class="sc">a.m.</span>,
there took place the <i lang="kij">sagali</i> (ceremonial
distribution). The food was given to people from various villages,
especially such as took part in the races, or had assisted in the
building of the new canoe. So we see that food contributed by all the
villages before the <i lang="kij">sagali</i> was simply redistributed
among them, a considerable quantity having been added first by the
chief; and this indeed is the usual procedure at a <i lang=
"kij">sagali</i>. In this case, of course, the lion&rsquo;s share was
taken by the Kitavans who helped at the building.</p>
<p>After the <i lang="kij">sagali</i> was over, the canoes were all
brought up to one spot, and the natives began to prepare them for the
race. The masts were stepped, the fastenings trimmed, the sails made
ready (see <a href="#pl31">Plate XXXI</a>). After that the canoes
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name=
"pb154">154</a>]</span>all put off and gathered about half a mile off
the shore, beyond the fringing reef; and at a sign given by some one on
one of them, they all started. As said before, such a run is not a race
properly speaking, in which the canoes would start scrupulously at the
same minute, have the same distance to cover, and which would clearly
show which is the fastest. In this case, it was merely, as always, a
review of the boats sailing along as well as they were able, a review
in which they all began to move, more or less at the same time, went in
the same direction, and covered practically the same distance.</p>
<p>As to the time table of the events, the <i lang="kij">sagali</i> was
over before mid-day. There was a pause; and then, at about one p.m.,
the natives began rigging the canoes. Then all hands had a spell, and
not before three p.m. were the races started. The whole affair was over
by about four o&rsquo;clock, and half an hour later, the boats from the
other villages started to sail home, the people on the shore dispersed,
so that by sunset, that is, about six o&rsquo;clock, the beach was
almost deserted.</p>
<p>Such was the <i lang="kij">tasasoria</i> ceremony which I saw in
February, 1916. It was a fine sight from the spectacular point of view.
A superficial onlooker could have hardly perceived any sign of white
man&rsquo;s influence or interference. I was the only white man
present, and besides myself only some two or three native missionary
teachers were dressed in white cotton. Amongst the rest of us there
could be seen sparsely a coloured rag, tied round as a neckerchief or
head-dress. But otherwise there was only a swarm of naked brown bodies,
shining with coco-nut oil, adorned in new festive dress, with here and
there the three-coloured grass skirt of a woman (see Plates <a href=
"#pl30">XXX</a> and <a href="#pl31">XXXI</a>).</p>
<p>But alas, for one who could look below the surface and read the
various symptoms of decay, deep changes would be discernible from what
must have been the original conditions of such a native gathering. In
fact, some three generations ago, even its appearances would have been
different. The natives then would have been armed with shields and
spears; some would have borne decorative weapons, such as the big
sword-clubs of hard wood, or massive ebony cudgels, or small
throwing-sticks. A closer inspection would have shown many more
decorations and ornaments, such as nose-sticks, finely carved lime
spatul&aelig;, gourds with burnt-in designs, some of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb155" href="#pb155" name=
"pb155">155</a>]</span>which are now out of use, or those used of
inferior workmanship or without decoration.</p>
<p>But other and much deeper changes have taken place in the social
conditions. Three generations ago both the canoes in the water and the
people on the shore would have been more numerous. As mentioned above,
in the olden days there would have been some twenty canoes in Kiriwina,
as against eight at the present time. Again, the far stronger influence
of the chief, and the much greater relative importance of the event
would have attracted a larger proportion out of the then more numerous
population. Nowadays, other interests, such as diving for pearls,
working on white man&rsquo;s plantations, divert the native attention,
while many events connected with Missions, Government and trading,
eclipse the importance of old customs.</p>
<p>Again, the people on the shore would have had to adhere in olden
days even more closely to the local distribution, men of the same
village community keeping together still more strictly, and looking
with mistrust and perhaps even hostility, at other groups, especially
those with whom they had hereditary feuds. The general tension would
often be broken by squabbles or even miniature fights, especially at
the moment of dispersing, and on the way home.</p>
<p>One of the important features of the performance, and the one of
which the natives think perhaps most&mdash;the display of
food&mdash;would also have been quite different. The chief whom I saw
sitting on a platform surrounded by a few wives only, and with small
attendance would, under the old conditions, have been the owner of
thrice as many wives and consequently relatives-in-law, and as it is
these from whom he derives most of his income, he would have provided a
much bigger <i lang="kij">sagali</i> than he is able to do
nowadays.</p>
<p>Three generations ago the whole event would have been much more
solemn and dramatic to the natives. The very distance to the
neighbouring island of Kitava is nowadays dwarfed. In the past, it
would not, as now, be quickly obliterated by a white man&rsquo;s
steam-launch. Then, the canoes on the beach were the only means of
arriving there, and their value in the eyes of the natives must have,
therefore, been even higher, although they think so much of them now.
The outlines of the distant island and the small fleet of canoes on
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb156" href="#pb156" name=
"pb156">156</a>]</span>the beach formed for the natives the first act
of a big over seas expedition, an event of far deeper significance to
them then than now. A rich haul of arm-shells, the arrival of many
much-coveted utilities, the bringing back of news from the far-off
land, all this meant much more in older days than it can mean at
present. War, dancing, and the Kula supplied tribal life with its
romantic and heroic elements. Nowadays, with war prohibited by the
Government, with dancing discredited by missionary influence, the Kula
alone remains, and even that is stripped of some of its glamour.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Before we proceed to the next stage, we must pause in
following the events of a Kula expedition, and consider one or two
points of more general importance. I have touched in the narrative, but
not dwelt upon, certain problems of the sociology of work. At the
outset of the preceding chapter it was mentioned that canoe-building
requires a definite organisation of work, and in fact we saw that in
the course of construction, various kinds of labour were employed, and
more especially towards the end, much use was made of communal labour.
Again, we saw that during the launching ceremony payment was given by
the owner to the expert and his helpers. These two points therefore,
the organisation of labour and communal labour in particular, and the
system of payment for experts&rsquo; work must be here developed.</p>
<p><i>Organisation of Labour</i>.&mdash;First of all, it is important
to realise that a Kiriwinian is capable of working well, efficiently
and in a continuous manner. But he must work under an effective
incentive: he must be prompted by some duty imposed by tribal
standards, or he must be lured by ambitions and values also dictated by
custom and tradition. Gain, such as is often the stimulus for work in
more civilised communities, never acts as an impulse to work under the
original native conditions. It succeeds very badly, therefore, when a
white man tries to use this incentive to make a native work.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the traditional view of the lazy and indolent
native is not only a constant refrain of the average white settler, but
finds its way into good books of travel, and even serious ethnographic
records. With us, labour is, or was till fairly recently, a commodity
sold as any other, in the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157" href=
"#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>open market. A man accustomed to
think in terms of current economic theory will naturally apply the
conceptions of supply and demand to labour, and he applies them
therefore to native labour. The untrained person does the same, though
in less sophisticated terms, and as they see that the native will not
work well for the white man, even if tempted by considerable payment
and treated fairly well, they conclude that his capacity for labour is
very small. This error is due to the same cause which lies at the
bottom of all our misconceptions about people of different cultures. If
you remove a man from his social milieu, you <i lang="la">eo ipso</i>
deprive him of almost all his stimuli to moral steadfastness and
economic efficiency and even of interest in life. If then you measure
him by moral, legal or economic standards, also essentially foreign to
him, you cannot but obtain a caricature in your estimate.</p>
<p>But the natives are not only capable of energetic, continuous and
skilful work; their social conditions also make it possible for them to
employ organised labour. At the beginning of <a href="#ch4">Chapter
IV</a>, the sociology of canoe-building was given in outline, and now,
after the details of its successive stages have been filled in, it is
possible to confirm what has been said there, and draw some conclusions
as to this organisation of labour. And first, as we are using this
expression so often, I must insist again on the fact that the natives
are capable of it, and that this contention is not a truism, as the
following considerations should show. The just mentioned view of the
lazy, individualistic and selfish savage, who lives on the bounties of
nature as they fall ripe and ready for him, implicitly precludes the
possibility of his doing effective work, <i>integrated into an
organised effort by social forces</i>. Again, the view, almost
universally accepted by specialists, is that the lowest savages are in
the pre-economic stage of individualistic search for food, whereas the
more developed ones, such as the Trobrianders, for instance, live at
the stage of isolated household economy. This view also ignores, when
it does not deny explicitly, the possibility of socially organised
labour.</p>
<p>The view generally held is that, in native communities each
individual works for himself, or members of a household work so as to
provide each family with the necessities of life. Of course, a canoe,
even a <i lang="kij">masawa</i>, could obviously be made by the members
of a household, though with less efficiency <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name="pb158">158</a>]</span>and
in a longer time. So that there is <i lang="la">a priori</i> nothing to
foretell whether organised labour, or the unaided efforts of an
individual or a small group of people should be used in the work. As a
matter of fact, we have seen in canoe-building a number of men engaged
in performing each a definite and difficult task, though united to one
purpose. The tasks were differentiated in their sociological setting;
some of the workers were actually to own the canoe; others belonged to
a different community, and did it only as an act of service to the
chief. Some worked in order to derive direct benefit from the use of
the canoe, others were to be paid. We saw also that the work of
felling, of scooping, of decorating, would in some cases be performed
by various men, or it might be performed by one only. Certainly the
minute tasks of lashing, caulking and painting, as well as sail-making,
were done by communal labour as opposed to individual. And all these
different tasks were directed towards one aim: the providing the chief
or headman with the title of ownership of a canoe, and his whole
community with its use.</p>
<p>It is clear that this differentiation of tasks, co-ordinated to a
general purpose, requires a well developed social apparatus to back it
up, and that on the other hand, this social mechanism must be
associated and permeated with economic elements. There must be a chief,
regarded as representative of a group; he must have certain formal
rights and privileges, and a certain amount of authority, and also he
must dispose of part of the wealth of the community. There must also be
a man or men with knowledge sufficient to direct and co-ordinate the
technical operations. All this is obvious. But it must be clearly set
forth that the real force which binds all the people and ties them down
in their tasks is obedience to custom, to tradition.</p>
<p>Every man knows what is expected from him, in virtue of his
position, and he does it, whether it means the obtaining of a
privilege, the performance of a task, or the acquiescence in a <i lang=
"la">status quo</i>. He knows that it always has been thus, and thus it
is all around him, and thus it always must remain. The chief&rsquo;s
authority, his privileges, the customary give and take which exist
between him and the community, all that is merely, so to speak, the
mechanism through which the force of tradition acts. For there is no
organised physical means <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href=
"#pb159" name="pb159">159</a>]</span>by which those in authority could
enforce their will in a case like this. Order is kept by direct force
of everybody&rsquo;s adhesion to custom, rules and laws, by the same
psychological influences which in our society prevent a man of the
world doing something which is not &ldquo;the right thing.&rdquo; The
expression &ldquo;might is right&rdquo; would certainly not apply to
Trobriand society. &ldquo;Tradition is right, and what is right
<i>has</i> might&rdquo;&mdash;this rather is the rule governing the
social forces in Boyowa, and I dare say in almost all native
communities at this stage of culture.</p>
<p>All the details of custom, all the magical formul&aelig;, the whole
fringe of ceremonial and rite which accompany canoe-building, all these
things add weight to the social scheme of duties. The importance of
magical ideas and rites as integrating forces has been indicated at the
outset of this description. It is easy to see how all the appurtenances
of ceremony, that is, magic, decoration, and public attendance welded
together into one whole with labour, serve to put order and
organisation into it.</p>
<p>Another point must be enlarged upon somewhat more. I have spoken of
<i>organised labour</i>, and of <i>communal labour</i>. These two
conceptions are not synonymous, and it is well to keep them apart. As
already defined, organised labour implies the co-operation of several
socially and economically different elements. It is quite another
thing, however, when a number of people are engaged side by side,
performing the same work, without any technical division of labour, or
social differentiation of function. Thus, the whole enterprise of
canoe-building is, in Kiriwina, the result of <i>organised labour</i>.
But the work of some twenty to thirty men, who side by side do the
lashing or caulking of the canoe, is <i>communal labour</i>. This
latter form of work has a great psychological advantage. It is much
more stimulating and more interesting, and it allows of emulation, and
therefore of a better quality of work. For one or two men, it would
require about a month to do the work which twenty to thirty men can do
in a day. In certain cases, as in the pulling of the heavy log from the
jungle to the village, the joining of forces is almost indispensable.
True, the canoe could be scooped out in the <i lang="kij">raybwag</i>,
and then a few men might be able to pull it along, applying some skill.
But it would entail great hardships. Thus, in some cases, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>communal labour is of extreme importance, and in
all casesit furthers the course of work considerably. Sociologically,
it is important, because it implies mutual help, exchange of services,
and solidarity in work within a wide range.</p>
<p>Communal labour is an important factor in the tribal economy of the
Trobriand natives. They resort to it in the building of living-huts and
storehouses, in certain forms of industrial work, and in the transport
of things, especially at harvest time, when great quantities of produce
have to be shifted from one village to another, often over a great
distance. In fishing, when several canoes go out together and fish each
for itself, then we cannot speak of communal labour. When on the other
hand, they fish in one band, each canoe having an appointed task, as is
sometimes done, then we have to do with organised labour. Communal
labour is also based upon the duties of <i lang="kij">urigubu</i>, or
relatives-in-law. That is, a man&rsquo;s relatives-in-law have to
assist him, whenever he needs their co-operation. In the case of a
chief, there is an assistance on a grand scale, and whole villages will
turn out. In the case of a commoner, only a few people will help. There
is always a distribution of food after the work has been done, but this
can hardly be considered as payment, for is is not proportional to the
work each individual does.</p>
<p>By far the most important part communal labour has to play, is in
gardening. There are as many as five different forms of communal labour
in the gardens, each called by a different name, and each distinct in
its sociological nature. When a chief or headman summons the members of
a village community, and they agree to do their gardens communally, it
is called <i lang="kij">tamgogula</i>. When this is decided upon, and
the time grows near for cutting the scrub for new gardens, a festive
eating is held on the central place, and there all men go, and <i lang=
"kij">takayva</i> (cut down) the scrub on the chief&rsquo;s plot. After
that, they cut in turn the garden plots of everyone, all men working on
the one plot during a day, and getting on that day food from the owner.
This procedure is reproduced at each successive stage of gardening; at
the fencing, planting of yams, bringing in supports, and finally, at
the weeding, which is done by women. At certain stages, the gardening
is often done by each one working for himself, namely at the clearing
of the gardens after they are burnt, at the cleaning of the roots
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href="#pb161" name=
"pb161">161</a>]</span>of yams when they begin to produce tubers, and
at harvesting.</p>
<p>There are, as a rule, several communal feasts during the progress,
and one at the end of a <i lang="kij">tamgogula</i> period. Gardens are
generally worked in this fashion, in years when big ceremonial dancing
or some other tribal festivity is held. This usually makes the work
very late, and it has then to be done quickly and energetically, and
communal labour has evidently been found suitable for this purpose.</p>
<p>When several villages agree to work their gardens by communal
labour, this is called <i lang="kij">lubalabisa</i>. The two forms do
not differ very much except by name, and also by the fact that, in the
latter form, more than one chief or headman has to direct the process.
The <i lang="kij">lubalabisa</i> would only be held when there are
several small villages, clustered together, as is the case in the
village compounds of Sinaketa, Kavataria, Kabwaku or Yalaka.</p>
<p>When a chief or headman, or man of wealth and influence summons his
dependents or his relatives-in-law to work for him, the name <i lang=
"kij">kabutu</i> is given to the proceedings. The owner has to give
food to all those co-operating. A <i lang="kij">kabutu</i> may be
instituted for one bit of gardening, for example, a headman may invite
his villagers to do his cutting for him, or his planting or his
fencing. It is clear that whenever communal labour is required by one
man in the construction of his house or yam store, the labour is of the
<i lang="kij">kabutu</i> type, and it is thus called by the
natives.</p>
<p>The fourth form of communal labour is called <i lang=
"kij">ta&rsquo;ula</i>, and takes place whenever a number of villagers
agree to do one stage of gardening in common, on the basis of
reciprocity. No great or special payments take place. The same sort of
communal labour extending over all stages of gardening, is called
<i lang="kij">kari&rsquo;ula</i>, and it may be counted as the fifth
form of communal labour in the gardens. Finally, a special word,
<i lang="kij">tavile&rsquo;i</i>, is used when they wish to say that
the gardens are done by individual labour, and that everyone works on
his own plot. It is a rule, however, that the chief&rsquo;s plots,
especially those of an influential chief of high rank, are always
gardened by communal labour, and this latter is also used with regard
to certain privileged plots, on which, in a given year, the garden
magic is performed first, and with the greatest display. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb162" href="#pb162" name="pb162">162</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus there is a number of distinct forms of communal labour, and
they show many more interesting features which cannot be mentioned in
this short outline. The communal labour used in canoe-building is
obviously of the <i lang="kij">kabutu</i> type. In having a canoe made,
the chief is able to summon big numbers of the inhabitants of a whole
district, the headman of an important village receives the assistance
of his whole community, whereas a man of small importance, such as one
of the smaller headmen of Sinaketa or Vakuta, would have to rely on his
fellow villagers and relations-in-law. In all these cases, it would be
the call of duty, laid down by custom, which would make them work. The
payment would be of secondary importance, though in certain
circumstances, it would be a considerable one. The distribution of food
during launching forms such a payment, as we have seen in Division I of
this chapter. In olden days, a meal of Pigs, an abundance of betel-nut
and coco-nut and sugar cane would have made a veritable feast for the
natives.</p>
<p>Another point of importance from the economic aspect is the payment
given by the chief to the builder of the canoe. The canoe of Omarakana
was made, as we saw, for To&rsquo;uluwa by a specialist from Kitava,
who was well paid with a quantity of food, pigs and <i lang=
"kij">vaygua</i> (native valuables). Nowadays, when the power of the
chiefs is broken, when they have much less wealth than formerly to back
up their position, and cannot use even the little force they ever did
and when the general breaking up of custom has undermined the
traditional deference and loyalty of their subjects, the production of
canoes and other forms of wealth by the specialist for the chief is
only a vestige of what it once was. In olden days it was, economically,
one of the most important features of the Trobriand tribal life. In the
construction of the canoe, Which a chief in olden days would never
build himself, we meet with an example of this.</p>
<p>Here it will be enough to say that whenever a canoe is built for a
chief or headman by a builder, this has to be paid for by an initial
gift of food. Then, as long as the man is at work, provisional gifts of
food are given him. If he lives away from home, like the Kitavan
builder on the beach of Omarakana, he is fed by the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> and supplied with dainties such as coco-nut,
betel-nut, pigs&rsquo; flesh, fish and fruits. When he works
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb163" href="#pb163" name=
"pb163">163</a>]</span>in his own home, the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>
will bring him choice food at frequent intervals, inspecting, as he
does so, the progress of the work. This feeding of the worker or
bringing him extra choice food is called <i lang="kij">vakapula</i>.
After the canoe is finished, a substantial gift is given to the
master-builder during the ceremonial distribution of food. The proper
amount would be a few hundred basketfuls of yams, a pig or two, bunches
of betel-nut, and a great number of coco-nuts; also, a large stone
blade or a pig, or a belt of red shell discs, and some smaller <i lang=
"kij">vaygua</i> of the non-Kula type.</p>
<p>In Vakuta, where chieftainship is not very distinct, and the
difference in wealth less great, a <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> also has
to feed the workers during the time of hollowing out, preparing, and
building a canoe. Then, after the caulking, some fifty <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e5854" title="Source: basketsful">basketfuls</span> are
given to the builder. After the launching and trial run, this builder
gives a rope, symbol of the canoe, to his wife, who, blowing the conch
shell, presents the rope to the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>. He, on the
spot, gives her a bunch of betel or bananas. Next day, a considerable
present of food, known as <i lang="kij">yomelu</i>, is given by the
chief, and then at the next harvest, another fifty or sixty basketfuls
of yams as <i lang="kij">karibudaboda</i> or closing up gift.</p>
<p>I have chosen the data from two concrete cases, one noted in
Kiriwina, the other in Vakuta&mdash;that is, in the district where the
chief&rsquo;s power is greatest, and in that where there never has been
more than a rudimentary distance in rank and wealth between chief and
commoner. In both cases there is a payment, but in Kiriwina the payment
is greater. In Vakuta, it is obviously rather an exchange of services,
whereas in Kiriwina the chief maintains, as well as rewards his
builder. In both cases we have the exchange of skilled services against
maintenance by supply of food.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We shall pass now to the next ceremonial and customary
performance in the succession of Kula events, to the display of a new
canoe to the friends and relatives of the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>.
This custom is called <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i>. The <i lang=
"kij">tasasoria</i> (launching and trial run) is obviously at the same
time the last act of ship-building, and by its associated magical rite,
by the foretaste of sailing, it is also one of the beginning stages of
the Kula. The <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i> being a presentation of the
new canoe, belongs <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164"
name="pb164">164</a>]</span>to the series of building ceremonials; but
in so far as it is a provisioning trip, it belongs to the Kula.</p>
<p>The canoe is manned with the usual crew, it is rigged and fitted out
with all its paraphernalia, such as paddles, baler, and conch shell,
and it sets out on a short trip to the beaches of the neighbouring
villages. When the canoe belongs to a compound settlement like
Sinaketa, then it will stop at every beach of the sister villages. The
conch shell is blown, and people in the village will know &ldquo;The
<i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i> men have arrived.&rdquo; The crew remains
in the canoe, the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> goes ashore, taking one
paddle with him. He goes to the house of his fellow-headman, and
thrusts the paddle into the frame of the house, with the words:
&ldquo;I offer thee thy <i lang="kij">bisila</i> (pandanus streamer);
take a <i lang="kij">vaygua</i> (valuable), catch a pig and break the
head of my new canoe.&rdquo; To which the local headman will
answer&mdash;giving a present: &ldquo;This is the <i lang=
"kij">katuvisala dabala</i> (the breaking of the head) of thy new
canoe!&rdquo; This is an example of the quaint, customary wording used
in the exchange of gifts, and in other ceremonial transactions. The
<i lang="kij">bisila</i> (pandanus streamer) is often used as a symbol
for the canoe, in magical spells, in customary expressions, and in
idiomatic terms of speech. Bleached pandanus streamers are tied to the
mast, rigging and sail; a specially medicated strip is often attached
to the prow of the canoe to give it speed, and there is also other
<i lang="kij">bisila</i> magic to make a district partner inclined for
Kula.</p>
<p>The gifts given are not always up to the standard of those mentioned
in the above customary phrase. The <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i>,
especially from the neighbouring villages, often brings only a few
mats, a few dozen coco-nuts, some betel-nut, a couple of paddles, and
such articles of minor value. And even in these trifles there is not
much gain from the short <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i>. For as we know,
at the beginning of the Kula all the canoes of, say, Sinaketa or
Kiriwina are either rebuilt or renewed. What therefore one canoe
receives on its <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i> round, from all the
others, will have to be more or less returned to them, when they in
their turn <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i> one after the other. Soon
afterwards, however, on an appointed day, all the canoes sail together
on a visit to the other districts, and on this <i lang=
"kij">kabigidoya</i>, they receive as a rule much more substantial
presents, and these they will only have to return much later, after a
year or two, when the visited district will come back to them on their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href="#pb165" name=
"pb165">165</a>]</span>own <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i>. Thus, when the
canoes of Kirwina are built and renovated for a big Kula expedition,
they will sail South along the coast, and stop first in Olivilevi,
receiving presents from the chief there, and walking on a round of the
inland villages of Luba. Then they will proceed to the next sea
village, that of Wawela, leaving their canoes there, and going from
there across to Sinaketa. Thence they proceed still further South, to
Vakuta. The villages on the Lagoon, such as Sinaketa and Vakuta, will
return these visits, sailing North along the Western shore on the
Lagoon side. Then they stop at Tukwaukwa or Kavataria, and from there
walk inland to Kiriwina, where they receive presents (see <a href=
"#map4">Map IV</a>, p. 50).</p>
<p>The <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i> trips of the Vakutans and
Sinaketans are more important than those of the Northern or Eastern
districts, because they are combined with a preliminary trade, in which
the visitors replenish their stock of goods, which they will need
presently on their trip South to Dobu. The reader will remember that
Kuboma is the industrial district of the Trobriands, where are
manufactured most of the useful articles, for which these islands are
renowned in the whole of Eastern New Guinea. It lies in the Northern
half of the island, and from Kiriwina it is only a few miles walk, but
to reach it from Sinaketa or Vakuta it is necessary to sail North. The
Southern villages therefore go to Kavataria, and from there walk inland
to Bwoytalu, Luya, Yalaka and Kadukwaykela, where they make their
purchases. The inhabitants of these villages also when they hear that
the Sinaketans are anchored in Kavataria, bring their wares to the
canoes.</p>
<p>A brisk trade is carried on during the day or two that the
Sinaketans remain in Kavataria. The natives of Kuboma are always eager
to buy yams, as they live in an unfertile district, and devote
themselves more to industrial productions than to gardening. And they
are still more eager to acquire coco-nuts and betel-nut, of which they
have a great scarcity. They desire besides to receive in exchange for
their produce the red shell discs manufactured in Sinaketa and Vakuta,
and the turtle-shell rings. For objects of great value, the Sinaketans
would give the big clay pots which they receive directly from the
Amphletts. For that they obtain different articles according to the
villages with which they are exchanging. From Bwoytalu, they get the
wonderfully fashioned and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb166" href=
"#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>decorated wooden dishes of various
sizes, depths and finish, made out of either hard or soft wood; from
Bwaytelu, Wabutuma and Buduwaylaka, armlets of plaited fern fibre, and
wooden combs; from Buduwaylaka, Yalaka, and Kadukwaykela, lime pots of
different qualities and sizes. From the villages of Tilataula, the
district North-east of Kuboma, the polished axe blades used to be
acquired in olden days.</p>
<p>I shall not enter into the technicalities of this exchange, nor
shall I give here the approximate list of prices which obtain. We shall
have to follow the traded goods further on to Dobu, and there we shall
see how they change hands again, and under what conditions. This will
allow us to compare the prices and thus to gauge the nature of the
transaction as a whole. It will be better therefore to defer all
details till then.</p>

<p class="first">Here, however, its seems necessary to make another
digression from the straight narrative of the Kula, and give an outline
of the various forms of trade and exchange as we find them in the
Trobriands. Indeed, the main theme of this volume is the Kula, a form
of exchange, and I would be untrue to my chief principle of method,
were I to give the description of one form of exchange torn out of its
most intimate context; that is, were I to give an account of the Kula
without giving at least a general outline of the forms of Kiriwinian
payments and gifts and barter.</p>
<p>In <a href="#ch2">Chapter II</a>, speaking of some features of
Trobriand tribal life, I was led to criticise the current views of
primitive economic man. They depict him as a being indolent,
independent, happy-go-lucky, yet at the same time governed exclusively
by strictly rational and utilitarian motives, and logical and
consistent in his behaviour. In this chapter again, in <a href=
"#div6.2">Division II</a>, I pointed out another fallacy implied in
this conception, a fallacy which declares that a savage is capable only
of very simple, unorganised and unsystematic forms of labour. Another
error more or less explicitly expressed in all writings on primitive
economics, is that the natives possess only rudimentary forms of trade
and exchange; that these forms play no essential part in the tribal
life, are carried on only spasmodically and at rare intervals, and as
necessity dictates. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167"
name="pb167">167</a>]</span></p>
<p>Whether we have to deal with the wide-spread fallacy of the
primitive Golden Age, characterised mainly by the absence of any
distinction between <i>mine</i> and <i>thine</i>; or whether we take
the more sophisticated view, which postulates stages of individual
search for food, and of isolated household catering; or if we consider
for the moment the numerous theories which see nothing in primitive
economics but simple pursuits for the maintenance of existence&mdash;in
none of these can we find reflected even a hint of the real state of
affairs as found in the Trobriands; namely, that <i>the whole tribal
life is permeated by a constant give and take</i>; that every ceremony,
every legal and customary act is done to the accompaniment of material
gift and counter gift; that wealth, given and taken, is one of the main
instruments of social organisation, of the power of the chief, of the
bonds of kinship, and of relationship in law.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e5973src" href="#xd26e5973" name="xd26e5973src">2</a></p>
<p>These views on primitive trade, prevalent though erroneous, appear
no doubt quite consistent, that is, if we grant certain premises. Now
these premises seem plausible, and yet they are false, and it will be
good to have a careful look at them so that we can discard them once
and for all. They are based on some sort of reasoning, such as the
following one: If, in tropical conditions, there is a plenty of all
utilities, why trouble about exchanging them? Then, why attach any
value to them? Is there any reason for striving after wealth, where
everyone can have as much as he wants without much effort? Is there
indeed any room for value, if this latter is the result of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>scarcity as well as utility, in a community, in
which all the useful things are plentiful? On the other hand, in those
savage communities where the necessities of life are scarce, there is
obviously no possibility of accumulating them, and thus creating
wealth.</p>

</div>
<p>Again, since, in savage communities, whether bountifully or badly
provided for by nature, everyone has the same free access to all the
necessities, is there any need to exchange them? Why give a basketful
of fruit or vegetables, if everybody has practically the same quantity
and the same means of procuring it? Why make a present of it, if it
cannot be returned except in the same form?<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6033src" href="#xd26e6033" name="xd26e6033src">3</a></p>
<p>There are two main sources of error at the bottom of this faulty
reasoning. The first is that the relation of the savage to material
goods is a purely rational one, and that consequently, in his
conditions, there is no room for wealth or value. The second erroneous
assumption is that there can be no need for exchange if anyone and
everyone can, by industry and skill, produce all that represents value
through its quantity or its quality.</p>
<p>As regards the first proposition, it is not true either with regard
to what may be called primary wealth, that is, food stuffs, nor with
regard to articles of luxury, which are by no means absent in Trobriand
society. First as to food-stuffs, they are not merely regarded by the
natives as nourishment, not merely valued because of their utility.
They accumulate them not so much because they know that yams can be
stored and used for a future date, but also because they like to
display their possessions in food. Their yam houses are built so that
the quantity of the food can be gauged, and its quality ascertained
through the wide interstices between the beams (see Plates <a href=
"#pl32">XXXII</a> and <a href="#pl33">XXXIII</a>). The yams are so
arranged that the best specimens come to the outside and are well
visible. Special <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169"
name="pb169">169</a>]</span>varieties of yams, which grow up to two
metres length, and weigh as much as several kilograms each, are framed
in wood and decorated with paint, and hung on the outside of the yam
houses. That the right to display food is highly valued can be seen
from the fact that in villages where a chief of high rank resides, the
commoners&rsquo; storehouses have to be closed up with coco-nut leaves,
so as not to compete with his.</p>
<p>All this shows that the accumulation of food is not only the result
of economic foresight, but also prompted by the desire of display and
enhancement of social prestige through possession of wealth.</p>
<p>When I speak about ideas underlying accumulation of food stuffs in
the Trobriands, I refer to the present, actual psychology of the
natives, and I must emphatically declare that I am not offering here
any conjectures about the &ldquo;origins&rdquo; or about the
&ldquo;history&rdquo; of the customs and their psychology, leaving this
to theoretical and comparative research.</p>
<p>Another institution which illuminates the native ideas about food
storage is the magic called <i lang="kij">vilamalya</i>, performed over
the crops after harvest, and at one or two other stages. This magic is
intended to make the food last long. Before the store-house is filled
with yams, the magician places a special kind of heavy stone on the
floor, and recites a long magical spell. On the evening of the same
day, after the food houses have been filled, he spits over them with
medicated ginger root, and he also performs a rite over all the roads
entering into the village, and over the central place. All this will
make food plentiful in that village, and will make the supplies last
long. But, and this is the important point for us, this magic is
conceived to act, not on the food, but on the inhabitants of the
village. It makes their appetites poor, it makes them, as the natives
put it, inclined to eat wild fruit of the bush, the mango and bread
fruit of the village grove, and refuse to eat yams, or at least be
satisfied with very little. They will boast that when this magic is
performed well, half of the yams will rot away in the storehouses, and
be thrown on the <i lang="kij">wawa</i>, the rubbish heap at the back
of the houses, to make room for the new harvest. Here again we meet the
typical idea that the main aim of accumulating food is to keep it
exhibited in the yam houses till it rots, and then can be replaced by a
new &eacute;talage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170"
name="pb170">170</a>]</span></p>
<p>The filling of the storehouses involves a double display of food,
and a good deal of ceremonial handling. When the tubers are taken out
of the ground they are first displayed in the gardens. A shed of poles
is erected, and covered with <i lang="kij">taitu</i> vine, which is
thrown thickly over it. In such arbours, a circle is pegged out on the
ground, and within this the <i lang="kij">taitu</i> (the ordinary small
yams of the Trobriands which form the staple harvest) are carefully
piled up into a conical heap. A great deal of care is lavished on this
task, the biggest are selected, scrupulously cleaned, and put on the
outside of the heap. After a fortnight or more of keeping the yams in
the garden, where they are much admired by visiting parties, the owner
of the garden plot summons a party of friends or relatives-in-law, and
these transport them into a village. As we know already, from <a href=
"#ch2">Chapter II</a>, such yams will be offered to the owner&rsquo;s
sister&rsquo;s husband. It is to his village that they are brought,
where again they are displayed in conical heaps, placed before his yam
house. Only after they have thus remained for several
days&mdash;sometimes up to a fortnight&mdash;are they put into the
storehouse (see <a href="#pl33">Plate XXXIII</a>).</p>
<p>Indeed, it would be enough for anyone to see how the natives handle
the yams, how they admire big tubers, how they pick out freaks and
sports and exhibit them, to realise that there is a deep, socially
standardised sentiment centring round this staple product of their
gardens. In many phases of their ceremonial life, big displays of food
form the central feature. Extensive mortuary distributions called
<i lang="kij">sagali</i>, are, in one of their aspects, enormous
exhibitions of food, connected with their re-apportionment (see
<a href="#pl34">Plate XXXIV</a>). At harvest of the early yams
(<i lang="kij">kuvi</i>) there is an offering of first fruits to the
memory of the recently dead. At the later, main harvest of <i lang=
"kij">taitu</i> (small yams), the first tubers are dug out ceremonially
brought into the village and admired by the whole community. Food
contests between two villages at harvest, in olden days often followed
by actual fighting, are also one of the characteristic features which
throw light on the natives&rsquo; attitude towards edible wealth. In
fact, one could almost speak of a &ldquo;cult of food&rdquo; among
these natives, in so far as food is the central object of most of their
public ceremonies.</p>
<p>In the preparation of food, it must be noted that many taboos are
associated with cooking, and especially with the cooking <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name=
"pb171">171</a>]</span>pots. The wooden dishes on which the natives
serve their food are called <i lang="kij">kaboma</i>, which means
&ldquo;tabooed wood.&rdquo; The act of eating is as a rule strictly
individual. People eat within their family circles, and even when there
is public ceremonial cooking of the taro pudding (<i lang=
"kij">mona</i>) in the big clay pots, especially tabooed for this
purpose (see <a href="#pl35">Plate XXXV</a>), they do not eat in one
body, but in small groups. A clay pot is carried into the different
parts of the village, and men from that part squat round it and eat,
followed afterwards by the women. Sometimes again the pudding is taken
out, placed on wooden dishes, and eaten within the family.</p>
<p>I cannot enter here into the many details of what could be called
the social psychology of eating, but it is important to note that the
centre of gravity of the feast lies, not in the eating, but in the
display and ceremonial preparation of the food (see <a href=
"#pl35">Plate XXXV</a>). When a pig is to be killed, which is a great
culinary and festive event, it will be first carried about, and shown
perhaps in one or two villages; then roasted alive, the whole village
and neighbours enjoying the spectacle and the squeals of the animal. It
is then ceremonially, and with a definite ritual, cut into pieces and
distributed. But the eating of it is a casual affair; it will take
place either within a hut, or else people will just cook a piece of
flesh and eat it on the road, or walking about in the village. The
relics of a feast such as pigs&rsquo; jaws and fish tails, however, are
often collected and displayed in houses or yam stores.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6111src" href="#xd26e6111" name=
"xd26e6111src">4</a></p>
<p>The quantity of food eaten, whether in prospect or retrospect, is
what matters most. &ldquo;We shall eat, and eat till we vomit,&rdquo;
is a stock phrase, often heard at feasts, intended to express enjoyment
of the occasion, a close parallel to the pleasure felt at the idea of
stores rotting away in the yam house. All this shows that the social
act of eating and the associated conviviality are not present in the
minds or customs of the Trobrianders, and what is socially enjoyed is
the common admiration of fine and plentiful food, and the knowledge of
its abundance. Naturally, like all animals, human or otherwise,
civilised or savage, the Trobrianders enjoy their eating as one of the
chief pleasures of life, but this remains an individual <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172" name="pb172">172</a>]</span>act,
and neither its performance nor the sentiments attached to it have been
socialised.</p>
<p>It is this indirect sentiment, rooted of course in reality in the
pleasures of eating, which makes for the value of food in the eyes of
the natives. This value again makes accumulated food a symbol, and a
vehicle of power. Hence the need for storing and displaying it. Value
is not the result of utility and rarity, intellectually compounded, but
is the result of a sentiment grown round things, which, through
satisfying human needs, are capable of evoking emotions.</p>
<p>The value of manufactured objects of use must also be explained
through man&rsquo;s emotional nature, and not by reference to his
logical construction of utilitarian views. Here, however, I think that
the explanation must take into account, not so much the user of these
objects, as the workman who produces them. These natives are
industrious, and keen workers. They do not work under the spur of
necessity, or to gain their living, but on the impulse of talent and
fancy, with a high sense and enjoyment of their art, which they often
conceive as the result of magical inspiration. This refers especially
to those who produce objects of high value, and who are always good
craftsmen and are fond of their workmanship. Now these native artists
have a keen appreciation of good material, and of perfection in craft.
When they find a specially good piece of material it lures them on to
lavish on it an excess of labour, and to produce things too good to be
used, but only so much the more desirable for possession.</p>
<p>The careful manner of working, the perfection of craftmanship, the
discrimination in material, the inexhaustible patience in giving the
final touches, have been often noted by those who have seen natives at
work. These observations have also come under the notice of some
theoretical economists, but it is necessary to see these facts in their
bearing upon the theory of value. That is, namely, that this loving
attitude towards material and work must produce a sentiment of
attachment to rare materials and well-worked objects, and that this
must result in their being valued. Value will be attached to rare forms
of such materials as the craftsman generally uses: classes of shell
which are scarce, lending themselves especially to fashioning and
polishing; kinds of wood which are also <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb173" href="#pb173" name="pb173">173</a>]</span>rare, like ebony; and
more particularly, special varieties of that stone out of which
implements are made.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6130src" href=
"#xd26e6130" name="xd26e6130src">5</a></p>
<p>We can now compare our results with the fallacious views on
Primitive Economic Man, sketched out at the beginning of this Division.
We see that value and wealth exist, in spite of abundance of things,
that indeed this abundance is valued for its own sake. Great quantities
are produced beyond any possible utility they could possess, out of
mere love of accumulation for its own sake; food is allowed to rot, and
though they have all they could desire in necessities, yet the natives
want always more, to serve in its character of wealth. Again, in
manufactured objects, and more especially in objects of the <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> type (comp. <a href="#div3.3">Chapter III, Div.
III</a>), it is not rarity within utility which creates value, but a
rarity sought out by human skill within the workable materials. In
other words, not those things are valued, which being useful or even
indispensable are hard to get, since all the necessities of life are
within easy reach of the Trobriand Islander. But such an article is
valued where the workman, having found specially fine or sportive
material, has been induced to spend a disproportionate amount of labour
on it. By doing so, he creates an object which is a kind of economic
monstrosity, too good, too big, too frail, or too overcharged with
ornament to be used, yet just because of that, highly valued.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Thus the first assumption is exploded, &ldquo;that
there is no room for wealth or value in native societies.&rdquo; What
about the other assumption, namely, &ldquo;That there is no need to
exchange if anyone can by industry and skill, produce all that
represents value through its quantity or its quality?&rdquo; This
assumption is confuted by realising a fundamental fact of native usage
and psychology: the love of give and take for its own sake; the active
enjoyment in possession of wealth, through handing it over.</p>
<p>In studying any sociological questions in the Trobriands, in
describing the ceremonial side of tribal life, or religion and magic,
we constantly meet with this give and take, with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb174" href="#pb174" name=
"pb174">174</a>]</span>exchange of gifts and payments. I had occasion
several times to mention this general feature, and in the short outline
of the Trobriand sociology in <a href="#ch2">Chapter II</a>, I gave
some examples of it. Even a walk across the island, such as we imagined
in that chapter, would reveal to an open-eyed Ethnographer this
economic truth. He would see visiting parties&mdash;women carrying big
food baskets on their head, men with loads on their shoulders&mdash;and
on inquiring he would learn that these were gifts to be presented under
one of the many names they bear, in fulfilment of some social
obligation. Offerings of first fruits are given to the chief or to
relatives-in-law, when the mango or bread fruit or sugar cane are ripe.
Big quantities of sugar cane being borne to a chief, carried by some
twenty to thirty men running along the road, produce the impressions of
a tropical Birnam Wood moving through the jungle. At harvest time all
the roads are full of big parties of men carrying food, or returning
with empty baskets. From the far North of Kiriwina a party will have to
run for some twelve miles to the creek of Tukwa&rsquo;ukwa, get into
canoes, punt for miles along the shallow Lagoon, and have another good
walk inland from Sinaketa; and all this is in order to fill the yam
house of a man who could do it quite well for himself, if it were not
that he is under obligation to give all the harvest to his
sister&rsquo;s husband! Displays of gifts associated with marriage,
with <i lang="kij">sagali</i> (food distributions), with payments for
magic, all these are some of the most picturesque characteristics of
the Trobriand garden, road and village, and must impress themselves
upon even a superficial observer.</p>
<p>The second fallacy, that man keeps all he needs and never
spontaneously gives it away, must therefore be completely discarded.
Not that the natives do not possess a strongly retentive tendency. To
imagine that they differ from other human beings in this, would be to
fall out of one fallacy into the opposite one also already mentioned,
namely that there is a sort of primitive communism among the natives.
On the contrary, just because they think so much of giving, the
distinction between mine and thine is not obliterated but enhanced; for
the presents are by no means given haphazardly, but practically always
in fulfilment of definite obligations, and with a great deal of formal
punctilio. The very fundamental motive of giving, the vanity of a
display of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb175" href="#pb175" name=
"pb175">175</a>]</span>possession and power, <i lang="la">a limine</i>
rules out any assumption of communistic tendencies or institutions. Not
in all cases, but in many of them, the handing over of wealth is the
expression of the superiority of the giver over the recipient. In
others, it represents subordination to a chief, or a kinship relation
or relationship-in-law. And it is important to realise that in almost
all forms of exchange in the Trobriands, there is not even a trace of
gain, nor is there any reason for looking at it from the purely
utilitarian and economic standpoint, since there is no enhancement of
mutual utility through the exchange.</p>
<p>Thus, it is quite a usual thing in the Trobriands for a type of
transaction to take place in which A gives twenty baskets of yams to B,
receiving for it a small polished blade, only to have the whole
transaction reversed in a few weeks&rsquo; time. Again, at a certain
stage of mortuary ritual, a present of valuables is given, and on the
same day later on, the identical articles are returned to the giver.
Cases like that described in the <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i> custom
(<a href="#div6.3">Div. III of this chapter</a>), where each owner of a
new canoe made a round of all the others, each thus giving away again
what he receives, are typical. In the <i lang=
"kij">wasi</i>&mdash;exchange of fish for yams, to be described
presently&mdash;through a practically useless gift, a burdensome
obligation is imposed, and one might speak of an increase of burdens
rather than an increase of utilities.</p>
<p>The view that the native can live in a state of individual search
for food, or catering for his own household only, in isolation from any
interchange of goods, implies a calculating, cold egotism, the
possibility of enjoyment by man of utilities for their sake. This view,
and all the previously criticised assumptions, ignore the fundamental
human impulse to display, to share, to bestow. They ignore the deep
tendency to create social ties through exchange of gifts. Apart from
any consideration as to whether the gifts are necessary or even useful,
giving for the sake of giving is one of the most important features of
Trobriand sociology, and, from its very general and fundamental nature,
I submit that it is a universal feature of all primitive societies.</p>
<p>I have dwelt at length on economic facts which on the surface are
not directly connected with the Kula. But if we realise that in these
facts we may be able to read the native&rsquo;s attitude towards wealth
and value, their importance for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb176" href="#pb176" name="pb176">176</a>]</span>main theme becomes
obvious. The Kula is the highest and the most dramatic expression of
the native&rsquo;s conception of value, and if we want to understand
all the customs and actions of the Kula in their real bearings we must,
first and foremost, grasp the psychology that lies at its basis.</p>

<p class="first">I have on purpose spoken of forms of exchange, of
gifts and counter-gifts, rather than of barter or trade, because,
although there exist forms of barter pure and simple, there are so many
transitions and gradations between that and simple gift, that it is
impossible to draw any fixed line between trade on the one hand, and
exchange of gifts on the other. Indeed, the drawing of any lines to
suit our own terminology and our own distinctions is contrary to sound
method. In order to deal with these facts correctly it is necessary to
give a complete survey of all forms of payment or present. In this
survey there will be at one end the extreme case of pure gift, that is
an offering for which nothing is given in return. Then, through many
customary forms of gift or payment, partially or conditionally
returned, which shade into each other, there come forms of exchange,
where more or less strict equivalence is observed, arriving finally at
real barter. In the following survey I shall roughly classify each
transaction according to the principle of its equivalence.</p>
<p>Such tabularised accounts cannot give the same clear vision of facts
as a concrete description might do, and they even produce the
impression of artificiality, but, and this must be emphatically stated,
I shall not introduce here artificial categories, foreign to the native
mind. Nothing is so misleading in ethnographic accounts as the
description of facts of native civilisations in terms of our own. This,
however, shall not be done here. The principles of arrangement,
although quite beyond the comprehension of the natives, are
nevertheless contained in their social organisation, customs, and even
in their linguistic terminology. This latter always affords the
simplest and surest means of approach towards the understanding of
native distinctions and classifications. But it also must be remembered
that, though important as a clue to native ideas, the knowledge of
terminology is not a miraculous short-cut into the native&rsquo;s mind.
As a matter of fact, there <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb177" href=
"#pb177" name="pb177">177</a>]</span>exist many salient and extremely
important features of Trobriand sociology and social psychology, which
are not covered by any term, whereas their language distinguishes
sub-divisions and subtleties which are quite irrelevant with regard to
actual conditions. Thus, a survey of terminology must always be
supplemented by a direct analysis of ethnographic fact and inquiry into
the native&rsquo;s ideas, that is, by collecting a body of opinions,
typical expressions, and customary phrases by direct cross-questioning.
The most conclusive and deepest insight, however, must always be
obtained by a study of behaviour, by analysis of ethnographic custom
and concrete cases of traditional rules.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h4 class="main">List of Gifts, Payments, and Commercial
Transactions.</h4>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">1. <i>Pure Gifts</i>.&mdash;By this, as just
mentioned, we understand an act, in which an individual gives an object
or renders a service without expecting or getting any return. This is
not a type of transaction very frequently met in Trobriand tribal life.
It must be remembered that accidental or spontaneous gifts, such as
alms or charities, do not exist, since everybody in need would be
maintained by his or her family. Again, there are so many well-defined
economic obligations, connected with kinship and relationship-in-law,
that anyone wanting a thing or a service would know where to go and ask
for it. And then, of course, it would not be a free gift, but one
imposed by some social obligation. Moreover, since gifts in the
Trobriands are conceived as definite acts with a social meaning, rather
than transmissions of objects, it results that where social duties do
not directly impose them, gifts are very rare.</p>
<p>The most important type of free gift are the presents characteristic
of relations between husband and wife, and parents and children. Among
the Trobrianders, husband and wife own their things separately. There
are man&rsquo;s and woman&rsquo;s possessions, and each of the two
partners has a special part of the household goods under control. When
one of them dies, his or her relations inherit the things. But though
the possessions are not joint, they very often give presents to one
another, more especially a husband to his wife.</p>
<p>As to the parents&rsquo; gifts to the children, it is clear that in
a matrilineal society, where the mother is the nearest of kin to
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb178" href="#pb178" name=
"pb178">178</a>]</span>her children in a sense quite different to that
in our society, they share in and inherit from her all her possessions.
It is more remarkable that the father, who, according to native belief
and law, is only the mother&rsquo;s husband, and not the kinsman of the
children, is the only relation from whom free gifts are
expected.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6203src" href="#xd26e6203" name=
"xd26e6203src">6</a> The father will give freely of his valuables to a
son, and he will transmit to him his relationships in the Kula,
according to the definite rules by which it is done (see <a href=
"#div11.2">Chapter XI, Division II</a>). Also, one of the most valuable
and valued possessions, the knowledge of magic, is handed over
willingly, and free of any counter-gift, from father to son. The
ownership of trees in the village grove and ownership in garden plots
is ceded by the father to his son during the lifetime of the former. At
his death, it often has to be returned to the man&rsquo;s rightful
heirs, that is, his sister&rsquo;s children. All the objects of use
embraced by the term <i lang="kij">gugua</i> will be shared with him as
a matter of course by a man&rsquo;s children. Also, any special
luxuries in food, or such things as betel-nut or tobacco, he will share
with his children as well as with his wife. In all such small articles
of indulgence, free distribution will also obtain between the chief or
the headman and his vassals, though not in such a generous spirit, as
within the family. In fact, everyone who possesses betel-nut or tobacco
in excess of what he can actually consume on the spot, would be
expected to give it away. This very special rule, which also happens to
apply to such articles as are generally used by white men for trade,
has largely contributed to the tenacity of the idea of the communistic
native. In fact, many a man will carefully conceal any surplus so as to
avoid the obligation of sharing it and yet escape the opprobrium
attaching to meanness.</p>
<p>There is no comprehensive name for this class of free gifts in
native terminology. The verb &ldquo;to give&rdquo; (<i lang=
"kij">sayki</i>) would simply be used, and on inquiry as to whether
there was repayment for such a gift, the natives would directly answer
that this was a gift without repayment; <i lang="kij">mapula</i> being
the general term for return gifts, and retributions, economic as well
as otherwise. The natives undoubtedly would not think of free gifts as
forming one class, as being all of the same nature. The acts of
liberality on the part of the chief, the sharing of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href="#pb179" name=
"pb179">179</a>]</span>tobacco and betel-nut by anybody who has some to
spare, would be taken as a matter of course. Gifts by a husband to a
wife are considered also as rooted in the nature of this relationship.
They have as a matter of fact a very coarse and direct way of
formulating that such gifts are the <i lang="kij">mapula</i> (payment)
for matrimonial relations, a conception in harmony with the ideas
underlying another type of gift, of which I shall speak presently, that
given in return for sexual intercourse. Economically the two are
entirely different, since those of husband to wife are casual gifts
within a permanent relationship, whereas the others are definite
payment for favours given on special occasions.</p>
<p>The most remarkable fact, however, is that the same explanation is
given for the free gifts given by the father to his children; that is
to say, a gift given by a father to his son is said to be a repayment
for the man&rsquo;s relationship to the son&rsquo;s mother. According
to the matrilineal set of ideas about kinship, mother and son are one,
but the father is a stranger (<i lang="kij">tomakava</i>) to his son,
an expression often used when these matters are discussed. There is no
doubt, however, that the state of affairs is much more complex, for
there is a very strong direct emotional attitude between father and
child. The father wants always to give things to his child, as I have
said, (compare <a href="#div2.6">Chapter II, Division VI</a>), and this
is very well realised by the natives themselves.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the psychology underlying these conditions is
this: normally a man is emotionally attached to his wife, and has a
very strong personal affection towards his children, and expresses
these feelings by gifts, and more especially by trying to endow his
children with as much of his wealth and position as he can. This,
however, runs counter to the matrilineal principle as well as to the
general rule that all gifts require repayment, and so these gifts are
explained away by the natives in a manner that agrees with these rules.
The above crude explanation of the natives by reference to sex payment
is a document, which in a very illuminating manner shows up the
conflict between the matrilineal theory and the actual sentiments of
the natives, and also how necessary it is to check the explicit
statements of natives, and the views contained in their terms and
phraseology by direct observation of full-blooded life, in which we see
man not only laying down <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href=
"#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>rules and theories, but behaving
under the impulse of instinct and emotion.</p>
<p>2. <i>Customary payments, re-paid irregularly, and without strict
equivalence</i>.&mdash;The most important of these are the annual
payments received at harvest time by a man from his wife&rsquo;s
brothers (cf. <a href="#div2.4">Chapter II, Divisions IV</a> and
<a href="#div2.5">V</a>). These regular and unfailing gifts are so
substantial, that they form the bulk of a man&rsquo;s income in food.
Sociologically, they are perhaps the strongest strand in the fabric of
the Trobriands tribal constitution. They entail a life-long obligation
of every man to work for his kinswomen and their families. When a boy
begins to garden, he does it for his mother. When his sisters grow up
and marry, he works for them. If he has neither mother nor sisters, his
nearest female blood relation will claim the proceeds of his
labour.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e6251src" href="#xd26e6251" name=
"xd26e6251src">7</a></p>
<p>The reciprocity in these gifts never amounts to their full value,
but the recipient is supposed to give a valuable (<i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>) or a pig to his wife&rsquo;s brother from time
to time. Again if he summons his wife&rsquo;s kinsmen to do communal
work for him, according to the <i lang="kij">kabutu</i> system, he pays
them in food. In this case also the payments are not the full
equivalent of the services rendered. Thus we see that the relationship
between a man and his wife&rsquo;s kinsmen is full of mutual gifts and
services, in which repayment, however, by the husband, is not
equivalent and regular, but spasmodic and smaller in value than his own
share; and even if for some reason or other it ever fails, this does
not relieve the others from their obligations. In the case of a chief,
the duties of his numerous relatives-in-law have to be much more
stringently observed; that is, they have to give him much bigger
harvest gifts, and they also have to keep pigs, and grow betel and
coco-nut palms for him. For all this, they are rewarded by
correspondingly large presents of valuables, which again, however, do
not fully repay them for their contributions.</p>
<p>The tributes given by vassal village communities to a chief and
usually repaid by small counter-gifts, also belong to this class.
Besides these, there are the contributions given by one kinsman to
another, when this latter has to carry out a mortuary distribution
(<i lang="kij">sagali</i>). Such contributions are sometimes,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb181" href="#pb181" name=
"pb181">181</a>]</span>but irregularly and spasmodically, repaid by
objects of small value.</p>
<p>The natives do not embrace this class under one term, but the word
<i lang="kij">urigubu</i>, which designates harvest gifts from the
wife&rsquo;s brothers, stands for one of the most important conceptions
of native sociology and economics. They have quite a clear idea about
the many characteristics of the <i lang="kij">urigubu</i> duties, which
have <a id="xd26e6280" name="xd26e6280"></a>been described here, and
about their far-reaching importance. The occasional counter gifts given
by the husband to his wife&rsquo;s kinsmen are called <i lang=
"kij">youlo</i>. The chief&rsquo;s tributes which we have put in this
category are called <i lang="kij">pokala</i>. The placing of these two
types of payment in one category is justified both by the similar
mechanism, and by the close resemblance between the <i lang=
"kij">urigubu</i> gifts, when given to a chief, and the <i lang=
"kij">pokala</i> received by him. There are even resemblances in the
actual ceremonial, which however, would require too much of a detailed
description to be more than mentioned here. The word <i lang=
"kij">pokala</i> is a general term for the chief&rsquo;s tributes, and
there are several other expressions which cover gifts of first fruit,
gifts at the main harvest, and some other sub-divisions. There are also
terms describing the various counter-gifts given by a chief to those
who pay him tribute, according to whether they consist of pig&rsquo;s
flesh or yams or fruit. I am not mentioning all these native words, in
order not to overload the account with details, which would be
irrelevant here.</p>
<p>3. <i>Payment for services rendered</i>. This class differs from the
foregoing one in that here the payment is within limits defined by
custom. It has to be given each time the service is performed, but we
cannot speak here of direct economic equivalence, since one of the
terms of the equation consists of a service, the value of which cannot
be assessed, except by conventional estimates. All services done by
specialists for individuals or for the community, belong here. The most
important of these are undoubtedly the services of the magician. The
garden magician, for instance, receives definite gifts from the
community and from certain individuals. The sorcerer is paid by the man
who asks him to kill or who desires to be healed. The presents given
for magic of rain and fair weather are very considerable. I have
already described the payments given to a canoe-builder. I shall have
to speak later on of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb182" href="#pb182"
name="pb182">182</a>]</span>those received by the specialists who make
the various types of <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>.</p>
<p>Here also belong the payments, always associated with love
intrigues. Disinterested love is quite unknown among these people of
great sexual laxity. Every time a girl favours her lover, some small
gift has to be given immediately. This is the case in the normal
intrigues, going on every night in the village between unmarried girls
and boys, and also in more ceremonial cases of indulgence, like the
<i lang="kij">katuyausi</i> custom, or the mortuary consolations,
mentioned in <a href="#div2.2">Chapter II, Division II</a>. A few
areca-nuts, some betel pepper, a bit of tobacco, some turtle-shell
rings, or spondylus discs, such are the small tokens of gratitude and
appreciation never omitted by the youth. An attractive girl need never
go unprovided with the small luxuries of life.</p>
<p>The big mortuary distributions of food, <i lang="kij">sagali</i>,
have already been mentioned several times. On their economic side,
these distributions are payments for funerary services. The deceased
man&rsquo;s nearest maternal kinsman has to give food gifts to all the
villagers for their assuming mourning, that is to say, for blackening
their faces and cutting their hair. He pays some other special people
for wailing and grave digging; a still smaller group for cutting out
the dead man&rsquo;s ulna and using it as a lime spoon; and the widow
or widower for the prolonged and scrupulously to be observed period of
strict mourning.</p>
<p>All these details show how universal and strict is the idea that
every social obligation or duty, though it may not on any account be
evaded, has yet to be re-paid by a ceremonial gift. The function of
these ceremonial re-payments is, on the surface of it, to thicken the
social ties from which arise the obligations.</p>
<p>The similarity of the gifts and payments which we have put into this
category is expressed by the native use of the word <i lang=
"kij">mapula</i> (repayment, equivalent) in connection with all these
gifts. Thus in giving the reason why a certain present is made to a
magician, or why a share is allotted to a man at the <i lang=
"kij">sagali</i> (distribution), or why some valuable object is given
to a specialist, they would say: &ldquo;This is the <i lang=
"kij">mapula</i> for what he has done.&rdquo; Another interesting
identification contained in linguistic usage is the calling of both
magical payments and payments to specialists: a
&lsquo;restorative,&rsquo; or, literally, a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb183" href="#pb183" name="pb183">183</a>]</span>
&lsquo;poultice.&rsquo; Certain extra fees given to a magician are
described as &lsquo;<i lang="kij">katuwarina kaykela</i>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;poultice for his leg&rsquo;; as the magician, especially he of
the garden or the sorcerer, has to take long walks in connection with
his magic. The expression &lsquo;poultice of my back,&rsquo; will be
used by a canoe-builder who has been bending over his work, or
&lsquo;poultice of my hand&rsquo; by a carver or stone-polisher. But
the identity of these gifts is not in any way expressed in the detailed
terminology. In fact, there is a list of words describing the various
payments for magic, the gifts given to specialists, love payments, and
the numerous types of gifts distinguished at the <i lang=
"kij">sagali</i>. Thus a magical payment, of which a small part would
be offered to ancestral spirits, is called <i lang=
"kij">ula&rsquo;ula</i>; a substantial magical gift is called <i lang=
"kij">sousula</i>; a gift to a sorcerer is described by the verb
<i lang="kij">ibudipeta</i>, and there are many more special names. The
gifts to the specialists are called <i lang="kij">vewoulo</i>&mdash;the
initial gift; <i lang="kij">yomelu</i>&mdash;a gift of food given after
the object has been ceremonially handed over to the owner; <i lang=
"kij">karibudaboda</i>&mdash;a substantial gift of yams given at the
next harvest. The gifts of food, made while the work is in progress are
called <i lang="kij">vakapula</i>; but this latter term has much wider
application, as it covers all the presents of cooked or raw food given
to workers by the man, for whom they work. The sexual gifts are called
<i lang="kij">buwana</i> or <i lang="kij">sebuwana</i>. I shall not
enumerate the various terminological distinctions of <i lang=
"kij">sagali</i> gifts, as this would be impossible to do, without
entering upon the enormous subject of mortuary duties and
distributions.</p>
<p>The classification of love gifts and <i lang="kij">sagali</i> gifts
in the same category with gifts to magicians and specialists, is a
generalisation in which the natives would not be able to follow us. For
them, the gifts given at <i lang="kij">sagali</i> form a class in
themselves and so do the love gifts. We may say that, from the economic
point of view, we were correct in classing all these gifts together,
because they all represent a definite type of equivalence; also they
correspond to the native idea that every service has to be paid for, an
idea documented by the linguistic use of the word <i lang=
"kij">mapula</i>. But within this class, the sub-divisions
corresponding to native terminology represent important distinctions
made by the natives between the three sub-classes; love gifts, <i lang=
"kij">sagali</i> gifts, and gifts for magical and professional
services. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb184" href="#pb184" name=
"pb184">184</a>]</span></p>
<p>4. <i>Gifts returned in economically equivalent form</i>.&mdash;We
are enumerating the various types of exchange, as they gradually assume
the appearance of trade. In this fourth class have been put such gifts
as must be re-paid with almost strict equivalence. But it must be
stressed that strict equivalence of two gifts does not assimilate them
to trade altogether. There can be no more perfect equivalence between
gift and counter-gift, than when A gives to B an object, and B on the
same day returns the very same object to A. At a certain stage of the
mortuary proceedings, such a gift is given and received back again by a
deceased man&rsquo;s kinsmen and his widow&rsquo;s brothers. Yet it is
obvious at once that no transaction could be further removed from
trade. The above described gifts at the presentation of new canoes
(<i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i>) belong to this class. So do also
numerous presents given to one community by another, on visits which
are going to be returned soon. Payments for the lease of a garden plot
are at least in certain districts of the Trobriands returned by a gift
of equivalent value.</p>
<p>Sociologically, this class of gifts is characteristic of the
relationship between friends (<i lang="kij">luba&rsquo;i</i>). Thus the
<i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i> takes place between friends, the Kula
takes place between overseas partners and inland friends, but of course
relations-in-law also belong <i>par excellence</i> to this
category.</p>
<p>Other types of equivalent gifts which have to be mentioned here
shortly, are the presents given by one household to another, at the
<i lang="kij">milamala</i>, the festive period associated with the
return of the ancestral spirits to their villages. Offerings of cooked
food are ceremonially exposed in houses for the use of the spirits, and
after these have consumed the spiritual substance, the material one is
given to a neighbouring household. These gifts are always
reciprocal.</p>
<p>Again, a series of mutual gifts exchanged immediately after marriage
between a man and his wife&rsquo;s father (not matrilineal kinsman in
this case), have to be put into this category.</p>
<p>The economic similarity of these gifts is not expressed in
terminology or even in linguistic use. All the gifts I have enumerated
have their own special names, which I shall not adduce here, so as not
to multiply irrelevant details of information. The natives have no
comprehensive idea that such a class as I have spoken of exists. My
generalisation is based upon the very interesting fact, that all
through the tribal life <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb185" href=
"#pb185" name="pb185">185</a>]</span>we find scattered cases of direct
exchange of equivalent gifts. Nothing perhaps could show up so clearly,
how much the natives value the give and take of presents for its own
sake.</p>
<p>5. <i>Exchange of Material Goods against Privileges, Titles and
non-material Possessions</i>. Under this heading, I class transactions
which approach trade, in so far as two owners, each possessing
something they value highly, exchange it for something they value still
more. The equivalence here is not so strict, at any rate not so
measurable, as in the previous class, because in this one, one of the
terms is usually a non-material possession, such as the knowledge of
magic, the privilege to execute a dance, or the title to a garden plot,
which latter very often is a mere title only. But in spite of this
smaller measure of equivalence, their character of trade is more
marked, just because of the element of mutual desire to carry out the
transaction and of the mutual advantage.</p>
<p>Two important types of transaction belong to this class. One of them
is the acquisition by a man of the goods or privileges which are due to
him by inheritance from his maternal uncle or elder brother, but which
he wishes to acquire before the elder&rsquo;s death. If a maternal
uncle is to give up in his life time a garden, or to teach and hand
over a system of magic, he has to be paid for that. As a rule several
payments, and very substantial ones, have to be given to him, and he
gradually relinquishes his rights, giving the garden land, bit by bit,
teaching the magic in instalments. After the final payment, the title
of ownership is definitely handed over to the younger man.</p>
<p>I have drawn attention already in the general description of the
Trobriand Sociology (<a href="#div2.6">Chapter II, Division VI</a>) to
the remarkable contrast between matrilineal inheritance and that
between father and son. It is noteworthy that what is considered by the
natives rightful inheritance has yet to be paid for, and that a man who
knows that in any case he would obtain a privilege sooner or later, if
he wants it at once, must pay for it, and that heavily. None the less,
this transaction takes place only when it appears desirable to both
parties. There is no customary obligation on either of the two to enter
on the exchange, and it has to be considered advantageous to both
before it can be completed. The acquisition of magic is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb186" href="#pb186" name="pb186">186</a>]</span>of
course different, because that must naturally always be taught by the
elder man to the younger in his life time.</p>
<p>The other type of transaction belonging to this class, is the
payment for dances. Dances are &ldquo;owned&rdquo;; that is, the
original inventor has the right of &ldquo;producing&rdquo; his dance
and song in his village community. If another village takes a fancy to
this song and dance, it has to purchase the right to perform it. This
is done by handing ceremonially to the original village a substantial
payment of food and valuables, after which the dance is taught to the
new possessors.</p>
<p>In some rare cases, the title to garden-lands would pass from one
community to another. For this again, the members and headman of the
acquiring community would have to pay substantially to those who hand
over their rights.</p>
<p>Another transaction which has to be mentioned here is the hire of a
canoe, where a temporary transference of ownership takes place in
return for a payment.</p>
<p>The generalisation by which this class has been formed, although it
does not run counter to native terminology and ideas, is beyond their
own grasp, and contains several of their sub-divisions, differentiated
by distinct native terms. The name for the ceremonial purchase of a
task or for the transfer of a garden plot is <i lang="kij">laga</i>.
This term denotes a very big and important transaction. For example,
when a small pig is purchased by food or minor objects of value, they
call this barter (<i lang="kij">gimwali</i>) but when a more valuable
pig is exchanged for <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, they call it
<i lang="kij">laga</i>.</p>
<p>The important conception of gradual acquisition in advance of
matrilineal inheritance, is designated by the term <i lang=
"kij">pokala</i>, a word which we have already met as signifying the
tributes to the chief. It is a homonym, because its two meanings are
distinct, and are clearly distinguished by the natives. There can be no
doubt that these two meanings have developed out of a common one by
gradual differentiation, but I have no data even to indicate this
linguistic process. At present, it would be incorrect to strain after
any connection between them, and indeed this is an example how
necessary it is to be careful not to rely too much on native
terminology for purposes of classification.</p>
<p>The term for the hire of a canoe is <i lang="kij">toguna waga</i>.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb187" href="#pb187" name=
"pb187">187</a>]</span></p>
<p>6. <i>Ceremonial barter with deferred payment</i>.&mdash;In this
class we have to describe payments which are ceremonially offered, and
must be received and re-paid later on. The exchange is based on a
permanent partnership, and the articles have to be roughly equivalent
in value. Remembering the definition of the Kula in <a href=
"#ch3">Chapter III</a>, it is easy to see that this big, ceremonial,
circulating exchange belongs to this class. It is ceremonial barter
based on permanent partnership, where a gift offered is always
accepted, and after a time has to be re-paid by an equivalent
counter-gift.</p>
<p>There is also a ceremonial form of exchange of vegetable food for
fish, based on a standing partnership, and on the obligation to accept
and return an initial gift. This is called <i lang="kij">wasi</i>. The
members of an inland village, where yams and taro are plentiful have
partners in a Lagoon village, where much fishing is done but garden
produce is scarce. Each man has his partner, and at times, when new
food is harvested and also during the main harvest, he and his fellow
villagers will bring a big quantity of vegetable food into the Lagoon
village (see <a href="#pl34">Plate XXXVI</a>), each man putting his
share before his partner&rsquo;s house. This is an invitation, which
never can be rejected, to return the gift by its fixed equivalent in
fish.</p>
<p>As soon as weather and previous engagements allow, the fishermen go
out to sea and notice is given to the inland village of the fact. The
inlanders arrive on the beach, awaiting the fishermen, Who come back in
a body, and their haul of fish is taken directly from the canoes and
carried to the inland village. Such large quantities of fish are always
acquired only in connection with big distributions of food (<i lang=
"kij">sagali</i>). It is remarkable that in the inland villages these
distributions must be carried out in fish, whereas in the Lagoon
villages, fish never can be used for ceremonial purposes, vegetables
being the only article considered proper. Thus the motive for exchange
here is not to get food in order to satisfy the primary want of eating,
but in order to satisfy the social need of displaying large quantities
of conventionally sanctioned eatables. Often when such a big fishing
takes place, great quantities of fish perish by becoming rotten before
they reach the man for whom they are finally destined. But being rotten
in no way detracts from the value of fish in a <i lang=
"kij">sagali</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb188" href="#pb188"
name="pb188">188</a>]</span></p>
<p>The equivalence of fish, given in return for vegetable food, is
measured only roughly. A standard sized bunch of taro, or one of the
ordinary baskets of <i lang="kij">taytu</i> (small yams) will be repaid
by a bundle of fish, some three to five kilograms in weight. The
equivalence of the two payments, as well as the advantage obtained by
one party at least, make this exchange approach barter.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e6497src" href="#xd26e6497" name="xd26e6497src">8</a>
But the element of trust enters into it largely, in the fact that the
equivalence is left to the repayer; and again, the initial gift which
as a rule is always given by the inlanders, cannot be refused. And all
these features distinguish this exchange from barter.</p>
<p>Similar to this ceremonial exchange are certain arrangements in
which food is brought by individuals to the industrial villages of
Kuboma, and the natives of that place return it by manufactured objects
when these are made. In certain cases of production of <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> (valuables) it is difficult to judge whether we
have to do with the payment for services rendered (Class 3), or with
the type of ceremonial barter belonging to this class. There is hardly
any need to add that the two types of exchange contained in this class,
the Kula and the <i lang="kij">wasi</i> (fish barter) are kept very
distinct in the minds of the natives. Indeed, the ceremonial exchange
of valuables, the Kula, stands out as such a remarkable form of trade
that in all respects, not only by the natives, but also by ourselves,
it must be put into a class by itself. There is no doubt, however, that
the technique of the <i lang="kij">wasi</i> must have been influenced
by the ideas and usages of the Kula, which is by far the more important
and widespread of the two. The natives, when explaining one of these
trades, often draw parallels to the other. And the existence of social
partnership, of ceremonial sequence of gift, of the free yet unevadible
equivalence, all these features appear in both forms. This shows that
the natives have a definite mental attitude towards what they consider
an honourable, ceremonial type of barter. The rigid exclusion of
haggling, the formalities observed in handing over the gift, the
obligation <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb189" href="#pb189" name=
"pb189">189</a>]</span>of accepting the initial gift and of returning
it later on, all these express this attitude.</p>
<p>7. <i>Trade, Pure and Simple</i>.&mdash;The main characteristic of
this form of exchange is found in the element of mutual advantage: each
side acquires what is needed, and gives away a less useful article.
Also we find here the equivalence between the articles adjusted during
the transaction by haggling or bargaining.</p>
<p>This bartering, pure and simple, takes place mainly between the
industrial communities of the interior, which manufacture on a large
scale the wooden dishes, combs, lime pots, armlets and baskets and the
agricultural districts of Kiriwina, the fishing communities of the
West, and the sailing and trading communities of the South. The
industrials, who are regarded as pariahs and treated with contumely,
are nevertheless allowed to hawk their goods throughout the other
districts. When they have plenty of articles on hand, they go to the
other places, and ask for yams, coco-nuts, fish, and betel-nut, and for
some ornaments, such as turtle shell, earrings and spondylus beads.
They sit in groups and display their wares, saying &ldquo;You have
plenty of coco-nuts, and we have none. We have made fine wooden dishes.
This one is worth forty nuts, and some betel-nut, and some betel
pepper.&rdquo; The others then may answer, &ldquo;Oh, no, I do not want
it. You ask too much.&rdquo; &ldquo;What will you give us?&rdquo; An
offer may be made, and rejected by the pedlars, and so on, till a
bargain is struck.</p>
<p>Again, at certain times, people from other villages may need some of
the objects made in Kuboma, and will go there, and try to purchase some
manufactured goods. People of rank as a rule will do it in the manner
described in the previous paragraph, by giving an initial gift, and
expecting a repayment. Others simply go and barter. As we saw in the
description of the <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i>, the Sinaketans and
Vakutans go there and purchase goods before each Kula expedition to
serve for the subsidiary trade.</p>
<p>Thus the conception of pure barter (<i lang="kij">gimwali</i>)
stands out very clearly, and the natives make a definite distinction
between this and other forms of exchange. Embodied in a word, this
distinction is made more poignant still by the manner in which the word
is used. When scornfully criticising bad conduct in Kula, or an
improper manner of giving gifts, a native will say <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb190" href="#pb190" name="pb190">190</a>]</span>that
&ldquo;it was done like a <i lang="kij">gimwali</i>.&rdquo; When asked,
about a transaction, whether it belongs to one class or another, they
will reply with an accent of depreciation &ldquo;That was only a
<i lang="kij">gimwali</i>&mdash;(<i lang="kij">gimwali
wala!</i>)&rdquo; In the course of ethnographic investigation, they
give clear descriptions, almost definitions of <i lang=
"kij">gimwali</i>, its lack of ceremony, the permissibility of
haggling, the free manner in which it can be done between any two
strangers. They state correctly and clearly its general conditions, and
they tell readily which articles may be exchanged by <i lang=
"kij">gimwali</i>.</p>
<p>Of course certain characteristics of pure barter, which we can
perceive clearly as inherent in the facts, are quite beyond their
theoretical grasp. Thus for instance, that the element of mutual
advantage is prominent in <i lang="kij">gimwali</i>; that it refers
exclusively to newly manufactured goods, because second-hand things are
never <i lang="kij">gimwali</i>, etc., etc. Such generalisations the
ethnographer has to make for himself. Other properties of the <i lang=
"kij">gimwali</i> embodied in custom are: absence of ceremonial,
absence of magic, absence of special partnership&mdash;all these
already mentioned above. In carrying out the transaction, the natives
also behave quite differently here than in the other transactions. In
all ceremonial forms of give and take, it is considered very
undignified and against all etiquette, for the receiver to show any
interest in the gift or any eagerness to take it. In ceremonial
distributions as well as in the Kula, the present is thrown down by the
giver, sometimes actually, sometimes only given in an abrupt manner,
and often it is not even picked up by the receiver, but by some
insignificant person in his following. In the <i lang=
"kij">gimwali</i>, on the contrary, there is a pronounced interest
shown in the exchange.</p>
<p>There is one instance of <i lang="kij">gimwali</i> which deserves
special attention. It is a barter of fish for vegetables, and stands
out in sharp contrast therefore to the <i lang="kij">wasi</i>, the
ceremonial fish and yam exchange. It is called <i lang="kij">vava</i>,
and takes place between villages which have no standing <i lang=
"kij">wasi</i> partnership and therefore simply <i lang=
"kij">gimwali</i> their produce when necessary (see <a href=
"#pl37">Plate XXXVII</a>).</p>
<p>This ends the short survey of the different types of exchange. It
was necessary to give it, even though in a condensed form, in order to
provide a background for the Kula. It gives us an idea of the great
range and variety of the material give and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>take
associated with the Trobriand tribal life. We see also that the rules
of equivalence, as well as the formalities accompanying each
transaction, are very well defined.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is easy to see that almost all the categories of
gifts, which I have classified according to economic principles, are
also based on some sociological relationship. Thus the first type of
gifts, that is, the free gifts, take place in the relationship between
husband and wife, and in that between parents and children. Again, the
second class of gifts, that is, the obligatory ones, given without
systematic repayment, are associated with relationship-in-law, mainly,
though the chief&rsquo;s tributes also belong to this class.</p>
<p>If we drew up a scheme of sociological relations, each type of them
would be defined by a special class of economic duties. There would be
some parallelism between such a sociological classification of payments
and presents, and the one given above. But such parallelism is only
approximate. It will be therefore interesting to draw up a scheme of
exchanges, classified according to the social relationship, to which
they correspond. This will give us good insight into the economics of
Trobriand sociology, as well as another view of the subject of payments
and presents.</p>
<p>Going over the sociological outline in <a href="#div2.5">Chapter II,
Divisions V</a> and <a href="#div2.6">VI</a>, we see that the family,
the clan and sub-clan, the village community, the district and the
tribe are the main social divisions of the Trobriands. To these
groupings correspond definite bonds of social relationship. Thus, to
the family, there correspond no less than three distinct types of
relationship, according to native ideas. First of all there is the
matrilineal kinship (<i lang="kij">veyola</i>) which embraces people,
who can trace common descent through their mothers. This is, to the
natives, the blood relationship, the identity of flesh, and the real
kinship. The marriage relation comprises that between husband and wife,
and father and children. Finally, the relationship between the husband
and the wife&rsquo;s matrilineal kinsmen forms the third class of
personal ties corresponding to family. These three types of personal
bonds are clearly distinguished in terminology, in the current
linguistic usage, in custom, and in explicitly formulated ideas.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb192" href="#pb192" name=
"pb192">192</a>]</span></p>
<p>To the grouping into clans and sub-clans, there pertain the ties
existing between clansmen and more especially between members of the
same sub-clan, and on the other hand, the relationship between a man
and members of different clans. Membership in the same sub-clan is a
kind of extended kinship. The relationship to other clans is most
important, where it assumes the form of special friendship called
<i lang="kij">luba&rsquo;i</i>. The grouping into village communities
results in the very important feature of fellow membership in the same
village community. The distinction of rank associated with clanship,
the division into village communities and districts, result, in the
manner sketched out in <a href="#ch2">Chapter II</a>, in the
subordination of commoners to chiefs. Finally, the general fact of
membership in the tribe creates the bonds which unite every tribesman
with another and which in olden days allowed of a free though not
unlimited intercourse, and therefore of commercial relations. We have,
therefore, eight types of personal relationship to distinguish. In the
following table we see them enumerated with a short survey of their
economic characteristics.</p>
<p>1. <i>Matrilineal kinship</i>.&mdash;The underlying idea that this
means identity of blood and of substance is by no means forcibly
expressed on its economic side. The right of inheritance, the common
participation in certain titles of ownership, and a limited right to
use one another&rsquo;s implements and objects of daily use are often
restricted in practice by private jealousies and animosities. In
economic gifts more especially, we find here the remarkable custom of
purchasing during lifetime, by instalments, the titles to garden plots
and trees and the knowledge of magic, which by right ought to pass at
death from the older to the younger generation of matrilineal kinsmen.
The economic identity of matrilineal kinsmen comes into prominence at
the tribal distributions&mdash;<i lang="kij">sagali</i>&mdash;where all
of them have to share in the responsibilities of providing food.</p>
<p>2. <i>Marriage ties</i>.&mdash;(Husband and wife; and derived from
that, father and children). It is enough to tabulate this type of
relationship here, and to remind the reader that it is characterised by
free gifts, as has been minutely described in the foregoing
classification of gifts, under (1). <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb193" href="#pb193" name="pb193">193</a>]</span></p>
<p>3. <i>Relationship-in-law</i>.&mdash;These ties are in their
economic aspect not reciprocal or symmetrical. That is, one side in it,
the husband of the woman, is the economically favoured recipient, while
the wife&rsquo;s brothers receive from him gifts of smaller value in
the aggregate. As we know, this relationship is economically defined by
the regular and substantial harvest gifts, by which the husband&rsquo;s
storehouse is filled every year by his wife&rsquo;s brothers. They also
have to perform certain services for him. For all this, they receive a
gift of <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> (valuables) from time to time,
and some food in payment for services rendered.</p>
<p>4. <i>Clanship</i>.&mdash;The main economic identification of this
group takes place during the <i lang="kij">sagali</i>, although the
responsibility for the food rests only with those actually related by
blood with the deceased man. All the members of the sub-clan, and to a
smaller extent members of the same clan within a village community,
have to contribute by small presents given to the organisers of the
<i lang="kij">sagali</i>.</p>
<p>5. <i>The Relationship of Personal Friendship</i>.&mdash;Two men
thus bound as a rule will carry on Kula between themselves, and, if
they belong to an inland and Lagoon village respectively, they will be
partners in the exchange of fish and vegetables (<i lang=
"kij">wasi</i>).</p>
<p>6. <i>Fellow-citizenship in a Village Community</i>.&mdash;There are
many types of presents given by one community to another. And,
economically, the bonds of fellow-citizenship mean the obligation to
contribute one&rsquo;s share to such a present. Again, at the mortuary
divisions, <i lang="kij">sagali</i>, the fellow-villagers of clans,
differing from the deceased man&rsquo;s, receive a series of presents
for the performance of mortuary duties.</p>
<p>7. <i>Relationship between Chiefs and Commoners</i>.&mdash;The
tributes and services given to a chief by his vassals on the one hand,
and the small but frequent gifts which he gives them, and the big and
important contribution which he makes to all tribal enterprises are
characteristic of this relationship.</p>
<p>8. <i>Relationship between any two tribesmen</i>.&mdash;This is
characterised by payments and presents, by occasional trade between two
individuals, and by the sporadic free gifts of tobacco or betel-nut
which no man would refuse to another unless they were on terms of
hostility. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb194" href="#pb194" name=
"pb194">194</a>]</span></p>
<p>With this, the survey of gifts and presents is finished. The general
importance of give and take to the social fabric of Boyowan society,
the great amount of distinctions and sub-divisions of the various gifts
can leave no doubt as to the paramount r&ocirc;le which economic acts
and motives play in the life of these natives. <span class=

adducing these views not for any controversial purposes, but to justify
and make clear why I stress certain general features of Trobriand
Economic Sociology. My contentions might run the danger of appearing as
gratuitous truisms if not thus justified. The opinion that primitive
humanity and savages have no individual property is an old prejudice
shared by many modern writers, especially in support of communistic
theories, and the so-called materialistic view of history. The
&ldquo;communism of savages&rdquo; is a phrase very often read, and
needs no special quotation. The views of individual search for food and
household economy are those of Karl B&uuml;cher, and they have directly
influenced all the best modern writings on Primitive Economics.
Finally, the view that we have done with Primitive Economics if we have
described the way in which the natives procure their food, is obviously
a fundamental premise of all the na&iuml;ve, evolutionary theories
which construct the successive stages of economic development. This
view is summarised in the following sentence: &ldquo;&hellip;&#8202;In
many simple communities, the actual food quest, and operations
immediately arising from it, occupy by far the greater part of the
people&rsquo;s time and energy, leaving little opportunity for the
satisfaction of any lesser needs.&rdquo; This sentence, quoted out of
&ldquo;Notes and Queries on Anthropology,&rdquo; p. 160, article on the
&ldquo;Economics of the Social Group,&rdquo; represents what may be
called the official view of contemporary Ethnology on the subject, and
in perusing the rest of the article, it can be easily seen that all the
manifold economic problems, with which we are dealing in this book,
have been so far more or less neglected.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=
"#xd26e5973src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6033" href="#xd26e6033src" name="xd26e6033">3</a></span> These
views had to be adduced at length, although touched upon already in
<a href="#div2.4">Chapter II, Division IV</a>, because they imply a
serious error with regard to human nature in one of its most
fundamental aspects. We can show up their fallacy on one example only,
that of the Trobriand Society, but even this is enough to shatter their
universal validity and show that the problem must be re-stated. The
criticised views contain very general propositions, which, however, can
be answered only empirically. And it is the duty of the field
Ethnographer to answer and correct them. Because a statement is very
general, it can none the less be a statement of empirical fact. General
views must not be mixed up with hypothetical ones. The latter must be
banished from field work; the former cannot receive too much
attention.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e6033src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e6111" href="#xd26e6111src" name="xd26e6111">4</a></span> As a
matter of fact, this custom is not so prominent in the Trobriands as in
other Massim districts and all over the Papuo-Melanesian world, cf. for
instance Seligman, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 56 and Plate VI, Fig.
6.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e6111src">&uarr;</a></p>

in explaining value, I do not wish to trace its possible origins, but I
try simply to show what are the actual and observable elements into
which the natives&rsquo; attitude towards the object valued can be
analysed.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e6130src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=

fishermen can earn about ten or twenty times more by diving for pearls
than by performing their share of the <i lang="kij">wasi</i>, the
exchange is as a rule a great burden on them. It is one of the most
conspicuous examples of the tenacity of native custom that in spite of
all the temptation which pearling offers them and in spite of the great
pressure exercised upon them by the white traders, the fishermen never
try to evade a <i lang="kij">wasi</i>, and when they have received the
inaugurating gift, the first calm day is always given to fishing, and
not to pearling.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

<h2 class="label">Chapter VII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Departure of an Overseas Expedition</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have brought the Kula narrative to the point where
all the preparations have been made, the canoe is ready, its ceremonial
launching and presentation have taken place, and the goods for the
subsidiary trade have been collected. It remains only to load the
canoes and to set sail. So far, in describing the construction, the
<i lang="kij">tasasoria</i> and <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i>, we spoke
of the Trobrianders in general. Now we shall have to confine ourselves
to one district, the southern part of the Island, and we shall follow a
Kula expedition from Sinaketa to Dobu. For there are some differences
between the various districts and each one must be treated separately.
What is said of Sinaketa, however, will hold good so far as the other
southern community, that of Vakuta, is concerned. The scene, therefore,
of all that is described in the following two chapters will be set in
one spot, that is, the group of some eight component villages lying on
the flat, muddy shore of the Trobriand Lagoon, within about a
stone&rsquo;s throw of one another. There is a short, sandy beach under
a fringe of palm trees, and from there we can take a comprehensive view
of the Lagoon, the wide semi-circle of its shore edged with the bright
green of mangroves, backed by the high jungle on the raised coral ridge
of the Raybwag. A few small, flat islands on the horizon just faintly
thicken its line, and on a clear day the mountains of the
d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux are visible as blue shadows in the far
distance.</p>
<p>From the beach, we step directly into one of the villages, a row of
houses faced by another of yam-stores. Through this, leaving on our
right a circular village, and passing through some empty spaces with
groves of betel and coco-nut palms, we come to the main component
village of Sinaketa, to Kasiyetana. There, overtopping the elegant
native huts, stands an enormous corrugated iron shed, built on piles,
but with the space between <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb196" href=
"#pb196" name="pb196">196</a>]</span>the floor and the ground filled up
carefully with white coral stones. This monument testifies both to
native vanity and to the strength of their superstitions&mdash;vanity
in aping the white man&rsquo;s habit of raising the house, and native
belief in the fear of the <i lang="kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i> (sorcerer),
whose most powerful sorcery is applied by burning magical herbs, and
could not be warded off, were he able to creep under the house. It may
be added that even the missionary teachers, natives of the Trobriands,
always put a solid mass of stones to fill the space beneath their
houses. To&rsquo;udawada, the chief of Kasiyetana, is, by the way, the
only man in Boyowa who has a corrugated iron house, and in fact in the
whole of the island there are not more than a dozen houses which are
not built exactly according to the traditional pattern.
To&rsquo;udawada is also the only native whom I ever saw wearing a
sun-helmet; otherwise he is a decent fellow (physically quite pleasant
looking), tall, with a broad, intelligent face. Opposite his iron
shanty are the fine native huts of his four wives.</p>

</div>
<p>Walking towards the North, over the black soil here and there
pierced by coral, among tall trees and bits of jungle, fields and
gardens, we come to Kanubayne, the village of Kouta&rsquo;uya, the
second most important chief in Sinaketa. Very likely we shall see him
sitting on the platform of his hut or yam-house, a shrivelled up,
toothless old man, wearing a big native wig. He, as well as
To&rsquo;udawada, belongs to the highest ranks of chieftainship, and
they both consider themselves the equals of the chiefs of Kiriwina. But
the power of each one is limited to his small, component village, and
neither in ceremonial nor in wealth did they, at least in olden days,
approach their kinsmen in the North. There is still another chief of
the same rank in Sinaketa, who governs the small village of Oraywota.
This is Sinakadi, a puffed up, unhealthy looking, bald and toothless
old man, and a really contemptible and crooked character, despised by
black and white alike. He has a well-established reputation of boarding
white men&rsquo;s boats as soon as they arrive, with one or two of his
young wives in the canoe, and of returning soon after, alone, but with
plenty of tobacco and good merchandise. Lax as is the
Trobriander&rsquo;s sense of honour and morality in such matters, this
is too much even for them, and Sinakadi is accordingly not respected in
his village. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb197" href="#pb197" name=
"pb197">197</a>]</span></p>
<p>The rest of the villages are ruled by headmen of inferior rank, but
of not much less importance and power than the main chiefs. One of
them, a queer old man, spare and lame but with an extremely dignified
and deliberate manner, called Layseta, is renowned for his extensive
knowledge of all sorts of magic, and for his long sojourns in foreign
countries, such as the Amphletts and Dobu. We shall meet some of these
chiefs later on in our wanderings. Having described the villages and
headmen of Sinaketa let us return to our narrative.</p>
<p>A few days before the appointed date of the departure of the Kula
expedition there is a great stir in the villages. Visiting parties
arrive from the neighbourhood, bringing gifts mostly of food, to serve
as provisions for the journey. They sit in front of the huts, talking
and commenting, while the local people go about their business. In the
evenings, long conferences are held over the fires, and late hours are
kept. The preparation of food is mainly woman&rsquo;s work, whereas the
men put the finishing touches to the canoes, and perform their
magic.</p>
<p>Sociologically the group of the departing differentiates itself of
course from those who remain. But even within that group a further
differentiation takes place, brought about by their respective
functions in the Kula. First of all there are the masters of the canoe,
the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>, who will play quite a definite part for
the next few weeks. On each of them fall with greater stringency the
taboos, whether those that have to be kept in Sinaketa or in Dobu. Each
has to perform the magic and act in ceremonies. Each will also enjoy
the main honours and privileges of the Kula. The members of the crew,
the <i lang="kij">usagelu</i>, some four to six men in each canoe, form
another group. They sail the craft, perform certain magical rites, and
as a rule do the Kula each on his own account. A couple of younger men
in each canoe, who do not yet kula, but who help in the work of
sailing, form another class, and are called <i lang="kij">silasila</i>.
Here and there a small boy will go with his father on a Kula
expedition&mdash;such are called <i lang=
"kij">dodo&rsquo;u</i>&mdash;and makes himself useful by blowing the
conch shell. Thus the whole fleet consists of four classes, that of the
<i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>, the <i lang="kij">usagelu</i>, the helpers
and the children. From Sinaketa, women, whether married or unmarried,
never go on overseas expeditions, though a different custom prevails in
the eastern part of the Trobriands. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb198" href="#pb198" name="pb198">198</a>]</span>Each <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> has to give a payment in food to his <i lang=
"kij">usagelu</i>, and this is done in the form of a small ceremony of
distribution of food called <i lang="kij">mwalolo</i>, and held after
the return from the expedition, in the central place of the
village.</p>
<p>A few days before the sailing, the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> starts
his series of magical rites and begins to keep his taboos, the women
busy themselves with the final Preparation of the food, and the men
trim the <i lang="kij">waga</i> (canoe) for the imminent, long
journey.</p>
<p>The taboo of the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> refers to his sexual
life. During the last two nights, he has in any case to be up late in
connection with his magical performances, and with the visits of his
friends and relatives from other villages, who bring provisions for the
voyage, presents in trade goods, and who chat about the forthcoming
expedition. But he has also to keep vigil far into the night as a
customary injunction, and he has to sleep alone, though his wife may
sleep in the same house.</p>
<p>The preparations of the canoe are begun by covering it with plaited
mats called <i lang="kij">yawarapu</i>. They are put on the platform,
thus making it convenient for walking, sitting and spreading about of
small objects. This, the first act of canoe trimming, is associated
with a magical rite. The plaited leaves are chanted over by the
<i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> on the shore as they are put on the canoe.
Or, in a different system of Kula magic the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>
medicates some ginger root and spits it on the mats in his hut. This is
a specimen of the magical formula which would be used in such a
rite:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Yawarapu Spell.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Betel-nut, betel-nut, female betel-nut;
betel-nut, betel-nut, male betel-nut; betel-nut of the ceremonial
spitting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The chiefs&rsquo; comrades; the chiefs and their followers;
their sun, the afternoon sun; their pig, a small pig. One only is my
day&rdquo;&mdash;here the reciter utters his own
name&mdash;&ldquo;their dawn, their morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the exordium of the spell. Then follows the main body. The
two words <i lang="kij">boraytupa</i> and <i lang="kij">badederuma</i>,
coupled together, are repeated with a string of other words. The first
word of the couple means, freely translated, &lsquo;quick
sailing,&rsquo; and the second one, &lsquo;abundant haul.&rsquo; The
string of words which are in succession tacked on to this couple
describe various forms of Kula necklaces. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb199" href="#pb199" name="pb199">199</a>]</span>The necklaces of
different length and of different finish have each their own class
names, of which there are about a dozen. After that, a list of words,
referring to the human head, are recited:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head, my nose, my occiput, my tongue, my throat, my
larynx, etc., etc.&rdquo; Finally, the various objects carried on a
Kula expedition are mentioned. The goods to be given (<i lang=
"kij">pari</i>); a ritually wrapped up bundle (<i lang=
"kij">lilava</i>); the personal basket; the sleeping mat; big baskets;
the lime stick; the lime pot and comb are uttered one after the
other.</p>
<p>Finally the magician recites the end part of the spell; &ldquo;I
shall kick the mountain, the mountain moves, the mountain tumbles down,
the mountain starts on its ceremonial activities, the mountain
acclaims, the mountain falls down, the mountain lies prostrate! My
spell shall go to the top of Dobu Mountain, my spell will penetrate the
inside of my canoe. The body of my canoe will sink; the float of my
canoe will get under water. My fame is like thunder, my treading is
like the roar of the flying witches.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The first part of this spell contains a reference to the betel-nut,
this being one of the things which the natives expect to receive in the
Kula. On the other hand, it is one of the substances which the natives
charm over and give to the partner to induce him to <i lang=
"kij">kula</i> with them. To which of these two acts the spell refers,
it is impossible to decide, nor can the natives tell it. The part in
which he extols his speed and success are typical of the magic
formul&aelig;, and can be found in many others.</p>
<p>The main part of the spell is as usual much easier to interpret. It
implies, broadly speaking, the declaration: &ldquo;I shall speed and be
successful with regard to the various forms of <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>; I shall speed and be successful with my head,
with my speech, with my appearance; in all my trade goods and personal
belongings.&rdquo; The final part of the spell describes the impression
which is to be made by the man&rsquo;s magic upon &lsquo;the
mountain,&rsquo; which stands here for the district of Dobu and its
inhabitants. In fact, the districts in the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux to
which they are sailing are always called <i lang="kij">koya</i>
(mountain). The exaggerations, the metaphors, and the implicit
insistence on the power of the spell are very characteristic of all
magical spells. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb200" href="#pb200"
name="pb200">200</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next day, or the day after, as there is often a delay in
starting, a pig or two are given by the master of the expedition to all
the participants. In the evening of that day, the owner of each canoe
goes into the garden, and finds an aromatic mint plant (<i lang=
"kij">sulumwoya</i>). Taking a sprig of it into his hand, he moves it
to and fro, uttering a spell, and then he plucks it. This is the
spell:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Who cuts the <i lang="kij">sulumwoya</i> of
Laba&rsquo;i? I, Kwoyregu, with my father, we cut the <i lang=

small basket &hellip; my mat &hellip; my <i lang="kij">lilava</i>
bundle &hellip; my presentation goods (<i lang="kij">pari</i>)
&hellip;&rdquo; And with each of these terms, the word
&lsquo;boils&rsquo; or &lsquo;foams up&rsquo; is repeated often several
times. After that, the same verb &lsquo;it boils&rsquo; is repeated
with all parts of the head, as in the previously quoted formula.</p>
<p>The last part runs thus: &ldquo;Recently deceased spirit of my
maternal uncle Mwoyalova, breathe thy spell over the head of
Monikiniki. Breathe the spell upon the head of my light canoe. I shall
kick the mountain; the mountain tilts over; the mountain subsides; the
mountain opens up; the mountain jubilates; it topples over. I shall
<i lang="kij">kula</i> so as to make my canoe sink. I shall <i lang=
"kij">kula</i> so as to make my outrigger go under. My fame is like
thunder, my treading is like the roar of the flying witches.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The exordium of this spell contains some mythical references, of
which, however, my informants could give me only confused explanations.
But it is clear in so far as it refers directly to the magical mint,
and describes its magical efficiency. In the second part, there is
again a list of words referring to objects used in the Kula, and to the
personal appearance and persuasiveness of the magician. The verb with
which they are repeated refers to the boiling of the mint and coco-nut
oil which I shall presently have to mention, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb201" href="#pb201" name="pb201">201</a>]</span>and
it indicates that the magical properties of the mint are imparted to
the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> and his goods. In the last part, the
magician invokes the spirit of his real maternal kinsman, from whom he
obtained this spell, and asks him to impart magical virtue to his
canoe. The mythological name, Monikiniki, with which there is no myth
connected, except the tradition that he was the original owner of all
these spells, stands here as synonym of the canoe. At the very end in
the <i lang="kij">dogina</i>, which contains several expressions
identical with those in the end part of the <i lang="kij">Yawarapu</i>
spell, we have another example of the strongly exaggerated language so
often used in magic.</p>
<p>After having thus ritually plucked the mint plant, the magician
brings it home. There he finds one of his <i lang="kij">usagelu</i>
(members of crew) who helps him by boiling some coco-nut oil (<i lang=
"kij">bulami</i>) in a small native clay pot. Into the boiling oil the
mint plant is put, and, while it boils, a magical formula is uttered
over it.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Kaymwaloyo Spell.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;No betel-nut, no <i lang="kij">doga</i>
(ornament of circular boar&rsquo;s tusk), no betel-pod! My power to
change his mind; my <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> magic, my <i lang=
"kij">mwase, mwasare, mwaserewai</i>.&rdquo; This last sentence
contains a play on words very characteristic of Kiriwinian magic. It is
difficult to interpret the opening sentence. Probably it means
something like this: &ldquo;No betel-nut or pod, no gift of a <i lang=
"kij">doga</i>, can be as strong as my <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> and
its power of changing my partner&rsquo;s mind in my favour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now comes the main part of the spell: &ldquo;There is one <i lang=
"kij">sulumwoya</i> (mint) of mine, a <i lang="kij">sulumwoya</i> of
Laba&rsquo;i which I shall place on top of Gumasila.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus shall I make a quick Kula on top of Gumasila; thus shall
I hide away my Kula on top of Gumasila; thus shall I rob my Kula on top
of Gumasila; thus shall I forage my Kula on top of Gumasila; thus shall
I steal my Kula on top of Gumasila.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last paragraphs are repeated several times, inserting instead
of the name of the island of Gumasila the following ones: Kuyawaywo,
Domdom, Tewara, Siyawawa, Sanaroa, Tu&rsquo;utauna, Kamsareta,
Gorebubu. All these are the successive names of places in which Kula is
made. In this long spell, the magician follows the course of a Kula
expedition, enumerating its most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb202"
href="#pb202" name="pb202">202</a>]</span>conspicuous landmarks. The
last part in this formula is identical with the last part of the
Yawarapu Spell, previously quoted: &ldquo;I shall kick the mountain,
etc.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>After the recital of this spell over the oil and mint, the magician
takes these substances, and places them in a receptacle made of banana
leaf toughened by grilling. Nowadays a glass bottle is sometimes used
instead. The receptacle is then attached to a stick thrust through the
prow boards of the canoe and protruding slantwise over the nose. As we
shall see later on, the aromatic oil will be used in anointing some
objects on arrival at Dobu.</p>
<p>With this, however, the series of magical rites is not finished. The
next day, early in the morning, the ritual bundle of representative
trade goods, called <i lang="kij">lilava</i>, is made up with the
recital of a magical spell. A few objects of trade, a plaited armlet, a
comb, a lime pot, a bundle of betel-nut are placed on a clean, new mat,
and into the folded mat the spell is recited. Then the mat is rolled
up, and over it another mat is placed, and one or two may be wrapped
round; thus it contains, hermetically sealed, the magical virtue of the
spell. This bundle is placed afterwards in a special spot in the centre
of the canoe, and is not opened till the expedition arrives in Dobu.
There is a belief that a magical portent (<i lang="kij">kariyala</i>)
is associated with it. A gentle rain, accompanied by thunder and
lightning, sets in whenever the <i lang="kij">lilava</i> is opened. A
sceptical European might add, that in the monsoon season it almost
invariably rains on any afternoon, with the accompaniment of thunder,
at the foot or on the slopes of such high hills as are found in the
d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux group. Of course when, in spite of that, a
<i lang="kij">kariyala</i> does not make its appearance, we all know
something has been amiss in the performance of the magical rite over
the <i lang="kij">lilava</i>! This is the spell recited over the
tabooed <i lang="kij">lilava</i> bundle.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;I skirt the shore of the beach of Kaurakoma;
the beach of Kayli, the Kayli of Muyuwa.&rdquo; I cannot add any
explanation which would make this phrase clearer. It obviously contains
some mythological references to which I have no key. The spell runs on:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb203" href="#pb203" name=
"pb203">203</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall act magically on my mountain&#8202;&hellip; Where
shall I lie? I shall lie in Legumatabu; I shall dream, I shall have
dream visions; rain will come as my magical portent&#8202;&hellip; his
mind is on the alert; he lies not, he sits not, he stands up and
trembles, he stands up and is agitated; the renown of Kewara is small,
my own renown flares up&#8202;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>This whole period is repeated over and over again, each time the
name of another place being inserted instead of that of Legumatabu.
Legumatabu is a small coral island some two hundred yards long and a
hundred yards wide, with a few pandanus trees growing on it, wild fowl
and turtle laying their eggs in its sand. In this island, half way
between Sinaketa and the Amphletts, the Sinaketan sailors often spend a
night or two, if overtaken by bad weather or contrary winds.</p>
<p>This period contains first a direct allusion to the magical portent
of the <i lang="kij">lilava</i>. In its second half it describes the
state of agitation of the Dobuan partner under the influence of this
magic, a state of agitation which will prompt him to be generous in the
Kula. I do not know whether the word Kewara is a proper name or what
else it may mean, but the phrase contains a boast of the
magician&rsquo;s own renown, very typical of magical formul&aelig;.</p>
<p>The localities mentioned instead of Legumatabu in the successive
repetitions of the period are: Yakum, another small coral island,
Urasi, the Dobuan name for Gumasila, Tewara, Sanaro&rsquo;a, and
Tu&rsquo;utauna, all localities known to us already from our
description of Dobu.</p>
<p>This is a very long spell. After the recital, and a very lengthy
one, of the last period with its variants, yet another change is
introduced into it. Instead of the first phrase &ldquo;where shall I
lie? etc.&rdquo; the new form runs &ldquo;Where does the rainbow stand
up? It stands up on the top of Koyatabu,&rdquo; and after this the rest
of the period is repeated: &ldquo;I shall dream, I shall have dream
visions, etc.&rdquo; This new form is again varied by uttering instead
of Koyatabu, Kamsareta, Koyava&rsquo;u, and Gorebubu.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e7007src" href="#xd26e7007" name="xd26e7007src">2</a> This
again carries us through the landscape; but here, instead of the
sleeping places we follow the beacons of the sailing expedition by
mentioning the tops of the high mountains. The end part of this spell
is again identical with that of the Yawarapu Spell.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb204" href="#pb204" name=
"pb204">204</a>]</span></p>
<p>This magical rite takes place on the morning of the last day.
Immediately after the recital of the spell, and the rolling up of the
<i lang="kij">lilava</i>, it is carried to the canoe, and put into its
place of honour. By that time the <i lang="kij">usagelu</i> (members of
the crew) have already made the canoe ready for sailing.</p>
<p>Each <i lang="kij">masawa</i> canoe is divided into ten, eleven, or
twelve compartments by the stout, horizontal poles called <i lang=
"kij">riu</i>, which join the body of the canoe with the outrigger.
Such a compartment is called <i lang="kij">liku</i>, and each <i lang=
"kij">liku</i> has its name and its function. Starting from the end of
the canoe, the first <i lang="kij">liku</i>, which, as is easily seen,
is both narrow and shallow, is called <i lang="kij">ogugwau</i>,
&lsquo;in the mist,&rsquo; and this is the proper place for the
conch-shell. Small boys will sit there and blow the conch-shell on
ceremonial occasions.</p>
<p>The next compartment is called <i lang="kij">likumakava</i>, and
there some of the food is stowed away. The third division is called
<i lang="kij">kayliku</i> and water-bottles made of coco-nut shells
have their traditional place in it. The fourth <i lang="kij">liku</i>,
called <i lang="kij">likuguya&rsquo;u</i>, is, as its name indicates,
the place for the <i lang="kij">guya&rsquo;u</i> or chief, which, it
may be added, is unofficially used as a courtesy title for any headman,
or man of importance. The baler, <i lang="kij">yalumila</i>, always
remains in this compartment. Then follow the central compartments,
called <i lang="kij">gebobo</i>, one, two or three, according to the
size of the canoe. This is the place where the <i lang="kij">lilava</i>
is put on the platform, and where are placed the best food, not to be
eaten till the arrival in Dobu, and all valuable trade articles. After
that central division, the same divisions, as in the first part are met
in inverse order (see <a href="#pl39">Plate XXXIX</a>).</p>
<p>When the canoe is going to carry much cargo, as is always the case
on an expedition to Dobu, a square space is fenced round corresponding
to the <i lang="kij">gebobo</i> part of the canoe. A big sort of square
hen-coop, or cage, is thus erected in the middle of the canoe, and this
is full of bundles wrapped up in mats, and at times when the canoe is
not travelling, it is usually covered over with a sail. In the bottom
of the canoe a floor is made by a framework of sticks. On this, people
can walk and things can rest, while the bilgewater flows underneath,
and is baled out from time to time. On this framework, in the <i lang=
"kij">gebobo</i>, four coco-nuts are placed, each in the corner of the
square, while a spell is recited over them. It is after that, that the
<i lang="kij">lilava</i> and the choice food, and the rest of the trade
are stowed away. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb205" href="#pb205"
name="pb205">205</a>]</span>The following spell belongs to the class
which is recited over the four coco-nuts.</p>

"kij">mwasila</i>.&rdquo; This short exordium, running in the
compressed style proper to magical beginnings, is rather enigmatic,
except for the mention of the Kula and <i lang="kij">mwasila</i>, which
explain themselves. The second part is less obscure:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall fill my canoe with <i lang="kij">bagido&rsquo;u</i>,
I shall fill my canoe with <i lang="kij">bagiriku</i>, I shall fill my
canoe with <i lang="kij">bagidudu</i>, etc.&rdquo; All the specific
names of the necklaces are enumerated. The last part runs as follows:
&ldquo;I shall anchor in the open sea, and my renown will go to the
Lagoon, I shall anchor in the Lagoon, and my renown will go to the open
sea. My companions will be on the open sea and on the Lagoon. My renown
is like thunder, my treading is like earthquake.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This last part is similar to several of the other formul&aelig;.
This rite is obviously a Kula rite, judging from the spell, but the
natives maintain that its special virtue is to make the food stuffs,
loaded into the canoe, last longer. After this rite is over, the
loading is done quickly, the <i lang="kij">lilava</i> is put into its
place of honour, and with it the best food to be eaten in Dobu. Some
other choice food to serve as <i lang="kij">pokala</i> (offerings) is
also put in the gebobo, to be offered to overseas partners; on it, the
rest of the trade, called <i lang="kij">pari</i>, is piled, and right
on top of all are the personal belongings of the <i lang=
"kij">usagelu</i> and the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> in their
respective baskets, shaped like travelling bags.</p>
<p>The people from the inland villages, <i lang=
"kij">kulila&rsquo;odila</i>, as they are called, are assembled on the
beach. With them stand the women, the children, the old men, and the
few people left to guard the village. The master of the fleet gets up
and addresses the crowd on the shore, more or less in these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Women, we others sail; you remain in the
village and look after the gardens and the houses; you must keep
chaste. When you get into the bush to get wood, may not one of you lag
behind. When you go to the gardens to do work keep together. Return
together with your younger sisters.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>He also admonishes the people from the other villages to keep away,
never to visit Sinaketa at night or in the evening, and never to come
singly into the village. On hearing that, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb206" href="#pb206" name="pb206">206</a>]</span>the headman of an
inland village will get up and speak in this fashion:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Not thus, oh, our chief; you go away, and your
village will remain here as it is. Look, when you are here we come to
see you. You sail away, we shall keep to our villages. When you return,
we come again. Perhaps you will give us some betel-nut, some sago, some
coco-nuts. Perhaps you will <i lang="kij">kula</i> to us some necklace
of shell beads.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>After these harangues are over, the canoes sail away in a body. Some
of the women on the beach may weep at the actual departure, but it is
taboo to weep afterwards. The woman are also supposed to keep the
taboo, that is, not to walk alone out of the village, not to receive
male visitors, in fact, to remain chaste and true to their husbands
during their absence. Should a woman commit misconduct, her
husband&rsquo;s canoe would be slow. As a rule there are recriminations
between husbands and wives and consequent bad feeling on the return of
the party; whether the canoe should be blamed or the wife it is
difficult to say.</p>
<p>The women now look out for the rain and thunder, for the sign that
the men have opened the <i lang="kij">lilava</i> (special magical
bundle). Then they know that the party has arrived on the beach of
Sarubwoyna, and performs now its final magic, and prepares for its
entrance into the villages of Tu&rsquo;utauna, and Bwayowa. The women
are very anxious that the men should succeed in arriving at Dobu, and
that they should not be compelled by bad weather to return from the
Amphletts. They have been preparing special grass skirts to put on,
when they meet the returning canoes on the beach; they also hope to
receive the sago, which is considered a dainty, and some of the
ornaments, which their men bring them back from Dobu. If for any reason
the fleet returns prematurely, there is great disappointment throughout
the village, because this means the expedition has been a failure,
nothing has been brought back to those left at home, and they have no
opportunity of wearing their ceremonial dress. <span class=

<p class="first">After so many preparations and preliminaries, we might
expect that, once embarked, the natives would make straight for the
high mountains, which beckon them alluringly from the distant South.
Quite on the contrary, they are satisfied with a very short stage the
first day, and after sailing a few miles, they stop on a big sand bank
called Muwa, lying to the southwest of the village of Sinaketa. Here,
near the sandy shore, edged with old, gnarled trees, the canoes are
moored by sticks, while the crews prepare for a ceremonial distribution
of food, and arrange their camp for the night on the beach.</p>
<p>This somewhat puzzling delay is less incomprehensible, if we reflect
that the natives, after having prepared for a distant expedition, now
at last for the first time find themselves together, separated from the
rest of the villagers. A sort of mustering and reviewing of forces, as
a rule associated with a preliminary feast held by the party, is
characteristic of all the expeditions or visits in the Trobriands.</p>
<p>I have spoken already about big and small expeditions, but I have
not perhaps made quite clear that the natives themselves make a
definite distinction between big, competitive Kula expeditions, called
<i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>, and sailings on a smaller scale, described
as &lsquo;just Kula,&rsquo; (&ldquo;Kula wala&rdquo;). The <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> are held every two or three years from each district,
though nowadays, as in everything else, the natives are getting slack.
One would be held, whenever there is a great agglomeration of <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, due to reasons which I shall describe later
on. Sometimes, a special event, such as the possession by one of the
head men of an exceptionally fine pig, or of an object of high value,
might give rise to an <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>. Thus, in 1918, a big
competitive expedition (<i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>) from Dobu was held
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb208" href="#pb208" name=
"pb208">208</a>]</span>ostensibly for the reason that Kauyaporu, one of
the head men of Tu&rsquo;utauna, owned a very large boar with tusks
almost curling over into a circle. Again, plenty of food, or in olden
days the completion of a successful war expedition, would form the
<i lang="fr">raison d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre</i> of an <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i>. Of course these reasons, explicitly given by the
natives, are, so to speak, accessory causes, for in reality an <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> would be held whenever its turn came, that is,
barring great scarcity of food or the death of an important
personage.</p>
<p>The <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> is a Kula expedition on an
exceptionally big scale, carried on with a definite social organisation
under scrupulous observance of all ceremonial and magical rites, and
distinguished from the smaller expeditions by its size, by a
competitive element, and by one or two additional features. On an
<i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>, all the canoes in the district will sail,
and they will sail fully manned. Everybody will be very eager to take
part in it. Side by side with this natural desire, however, there
exists the idea that all the members of the crews are under an
obligation to go on the expedition. This duty they owe to the chief, or
master of the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>. The <i lang=
"kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i>, as he is called, is always one of the
sectional chiefs or headmen. He plays the part of a master of
ceremonies, on leaving the beach of Sinaketa, at the distributions of
food, on arrival in the overseas villages, and on the ceremonial return
home. A streamer of dried and bleached pandanus leaf, attached to the
prows of his canoe on a stick, is the ostensible sign of the dignity.
Such a streamer is called <i lang="kij">tarabauba&rsquo;u</i> in
Kiriwinian, and <i lang="kij">doya</i> in the Dobuan language. The
headman, who is <i lang="kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i> on an expedition,
will as a rule receive more Kula gifts than the others. On him also
will devolve the glory of this particular expedition. Thus the title of
<i lang="kij">toli</i>, in this case, is one of honorary and nominal
ownership, resulting mainly in renown (<i lang="kij">butura</i>) for
its bearer, and as such highly valued by the natives.</p>
<p>From the economic and legal point of view, however, the obligation
binding the members of the expedition to him is the most important
sociological feature. He gives the distribution of food, in which the
others participate, and this imposes on them the duty of carrying out
the expedition, however hard this might be, however often they would
have to stop or even return owing to bad weather, contrary winds, or,
in olden<a id="xd26e7235" name="xd26e7235"></a> days, interference by
hostile natives. As the natives say, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb209" href="#pb209" name="pb209">209</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;We cannot return on <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>,
for we have eaten of the pig, and we have chewed of the betel-nut given
by the <i lang="kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku.</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Only after the most distant community with whom the Sinaketans
<i lang="kij">kula</i> has been reached, and after due time has been
allowed for the collection of any <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>
within reach, will the party start on the return journey. Concrete
cases are quoted in which expeditions had to start several times from
Sinaketa, always returning within a few days after all the provisions
had been eaten on Muwa, from where a contrary wind would not allow the
canoes to move south. Or again, a memorable expedition, some few
decades ago, started once or twice, was becalmed in Vakuta, had to give
a heavy payment to a wind magician in the village of Okinai, to provide
them with a propitious northerly wind, and then, sailing South at last,
met with a <i lang="kij">vineylida</i>, one of the dreadful perils of
the sea, a live stone which jumps from the bottom of the sea at a
canoe. But in spite of all this, they persevered, reached Dobu in
safety, and made a successful return.</p>
<p>Thus we see that, from a sociological point of view, the <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> is an enterprise partially financed by the <i lang=
"kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i>, and therefore redounding to his credit,
and bringing him honour; while the obligation imposed on others by the
food distributed to them, is to carry on the expedition to a successful
end.</p>
<p>It is rather puzzling to find that, although everyone is eager for
the expedition, although they all enjoy it equally and satisfy their
ambition and increase their wealth by it, yet the element of compulsion
and obligation is introduced into it; for we are not accustomed to the
idea of pleasure having to be forced on people. None the less, the
<i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> is not an isolated feature, for in almost all
tribal enjoyments and festive entertainments on a big scale, the same
principle obtains. The master of the festivities, by an initial
distribution of food, imposes an obligation on the others, to carry
through dancing, sports, or games of the season. And indeed,
considering the ease with which native enthusiasms flag, with which
jealousies, envies and quarrels creep in, and destroy the unanimity of
social amusements, the need for compulsion from without to amuse
oneself appears not so preposterous as at first sight.</p>
<p>I have said that an <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> expedition is
distinguished <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb210" href="#pb210" name=
"pb210">210</a>]</span>from an ordinary one, in so far also as the full
ceremonial of the Kula has to be observed. Thus all the canoes must be
either new or relashed, and without exception they must be also
repainted and redecorated. The full ceremonial launching, <i lang=
"kij">tasasoria</i>, and the presentation, <i lang=
"kij">kabigodoya</i>, are carried out with every detail only when the
Kula takes the form of an <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>. The pig or pigs
killed in the village before departure are also a special feature of
the competitive Kula. So is the <i lang="kij">kayguya&rsquo;u</i>
ceremonial distribution held on Muwa, just at the point of the
proceedings at which we have now arrived. The <i lang=
"kij">tanarere</i>, a big display of <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>
and comparison of the individual acquisitions at the end of an
expedition, is another ceremonial feature of the <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> and supplies some of the competitive element. There
is also competition as to the speed, qualities and beauties of the
canoes at the beginning of such an expedition. Some of the communities
who present their <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> to an <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> expedition vie with one another, as to who will give
most, and in fact the element of emulation or competition runs right
through the proceedings. In the following chapters, I shall have, in
several more points, occasion to distinguish an <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> from an ordinary Kula sailing.</p>
<p>It must be added at once that, although all these ceremonial
features are compulsory only on an <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> sailing,
and although only then are they one and all of them unfailingly
observed, some and even all may also be kept during an ordinary Kula
expedition, especially if it happens to be a somewhat bigger one. The
same refers to the various magical rites&mdash;that is to say the most
important ones&mdash;which although performed on every Kula expedition,
are carried out with more punctilio on an <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i>.</p>
<p>Finally, a very important distinctive feature is the rule, that no
<i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> can be carried on the outbound sailing
of an <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>. It must not be forgotten that a Kula
overseas expedition sails, in order mainly to receive gifts and not to
give them, and on an <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> this rule is carried to
its extreme, so that no Kula valuables whatever may be given by the
visiting party. The natives sailing from Sinaketa to Dobu on ordinary
Kula may carry a few armshells with them, but when they sail on a
ceremonial competitive <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>, no armshell is ever
taken. For it must be remembered that Kula exchanges, as has been
explained in <a href="#ch3">Chapter III</a>, never take place
simultaneously. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb211" href="#pb211"
name="pb211">211</a>]</span>It is always a gift followed after a lapse
of time by a counter-gift. Now on a <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> the
natives would receive in Dobu a certain amount of gifts, which, within
a year or so, would be returned to the Dobuans, when these pay a visit
to Sinaketa. But there is always a considerable amount of valuables
which the Dobuans owe to the Sinaketans, so that when now the
Sinaketans go to Dobu, they will claim also these gifts due to them
from previous occasions. All these technicalities of Kula exchange will
become clearer in one of the subsequent chapters (<a href=
"#ch14">Chapter XIV</a>).</p>
<p>To sum up, the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> is a ceremonial and
competitive expedition. Ceremonial it is, in so far as it is connected
with the special initial distribution of food, given by the master of
the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>. It is also ceremonial in that all the
formalities of the Kula are kept rigorously and without exception, for
in a sense every Kula sailing expedition is ceremonial. Competitive it
is mainly in that at the end of it all the acquired articles are
compared and counted. With this also the prohibition to carry <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, is connected, so as to give everyone an even
start.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Returning now to the Sinaketan fleet assembled at
Muwa, as soon as they have arrived there, that is, some time about
noon, they proceed to the ceremonial distribution. Although the
<i lang="kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i> is master of ceremonies, in this
case he as a rule sits and watches the initial proceedings from a
distance. A group of his relatives or friends of lesser rank busy
themselves with the work. It might be better perhaps here to give a
more concrete account, since it is always difficult to visualise
exactly how such things will proceed.</p>
<p>This was brought home to me when in March, 1918, I assisted at these
initial stages of the Kula in the Amphlett Islands. The natives had
been preparing for days for departure, and on the final date, I spent
the whole morning observing and photographing the loading and trimming
of the canoes, the farewells, and the setting out of the fleet. In the
evening, after a busy day, as it was a full-moon night, I went for a
long pull in a <span class="corr" id="xd26e7370" title=
"Source: dinghey">dinghy</span>. Although in the Trobriands I had had
accounts of the custom of the first halt, yet it gave me a surprise
when on rounding a rocky point I came upon the whole <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb212" href="#pb212" name=
"pb212">212</a>]</span>crowd of Gumasila natives, who had departed on
the Kula that morning, sitting in full-moon light on a beach, only a
few miles from the village which they had left with so much to-do some
ten hours before. With the fairly strong wind that day, I was thinking
of them as camping at least half way to the Trobriands, on one of the
small sand banks some twenty miles North. I went and sat for a moment
among the morose and unfriendly Amphlett Islanders, who, unlike the
Trobrianders, distinctly resented the inquisitive and blighting
presence of an Ethnographer.</p>
<p>To return to our Sinaketan party, we can imagine the chiefs sitting
high up on the shore under the gnarled, broad-leafed branches of the
shady trees. They might perhaps be resting in one group, each with a
few attendants, or else every headman and chief near his own canoe,
To&rsquo;udawada silently chewing betel-nut, with a heavy and bovine
dignity, the excitable Koutauya chattering in a high pitched voice with
some of his grown-up sons, among whom there are two or three of the
finest men in Sinaketa. Further on, with a smaller group of attendants,
sits the infamous Sinakadi, in conference with his successor to
chieftainship, his sister&rsquo;s son, Gomaya, also a notorious
scoundrel. On such occasions it is good form for chiefs not to busy
themselves among the groups, nor to survey the proceedings, but to keep
an aloof and detached attitude. In company with other notables, they
discuss in the short, jerky sentences which make native languages so
difficult to follow, the arrangements and prospects of the Kula, making
now and then a mythological reference, forecasting the weather, and
discussing the merits of the canoes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the henchmen of the <i lang=
"kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i>, his sons, his younger brothers, his
relatives-in-law, prepare the distribution. As a rule, either
To&rsquo;udawada or Koutauya would be the <i lang=
"kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i>. The one who at the given time has more
wealth on hand and prospects of receiving more <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, would take over the dignity and the burdens.
Sinakadi is much less wealthy, and probably it would be an exception
for him and his predecessors and successors to play the part. The minor
headmen of the other compound villages of Sinaketa would never fill the
r&ocirc;le.</p>
<p>Whoever is the master of the expedition for the time being will have
brought over a couple of pigs, which will now be laid <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb213" href="#pb213" name="pb213">213</a>]</span>on
the beach and admired by the members of the expedition. Soon some fires
are lit, and the pigs, with a long pole thrust through their tied feet,
are hung upside down over the fires. A dreadful squealing fills the air
and delights the hearers. After the pig has been singed to death, or
rather, into insensibility, it is taken off and cut open. Specialists
cut it into appropriate parts, ready for the distribution. Yams, taro,
coco-nuts and sugar cane have already been put into big heaps, as many
as there are canoes&mdash;that is, nowadays, eight. On these heaps,
some hands of ripe bananas and some betel-nut bunches are placed. On
the ground, beside them, on trays of plaited coco-nut leaves, the lumps
of meat are displayed. All this food has been provided by the <i lang=
"kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i>, who previously has received as
contributions towards it special presents, both from his own and from
his wife&rsquo;s kinsmen. In fact, if we try to draw out all the
strands of gifts and contributions connected with such a distribution
we would find that it is spun round into such an intricate web, that
even the lengthy account of the foregoing chapter does not quite do it
justice.</p>
<p>After the chief&rsquo;s helpers have arranged the heaps, they go
over them, seeing that the apportionment is correct, shifting some of
the food here and there, and memorising to whom each heap will be
given. Often in the final round, the <i lang=
"kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i> inspects the heaps himself, and then
returns to his former seat. Then comes the culminating act of the
distribution. One of the chief&rsquo;s henchmen, always a man of
inferior rank, accompanied by the chief&rsquo;s helpers, walks down the
row of heaps, and at each of them screams out in a very loud voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;O, Siyagana, thy heap, there, O Siyagana,
O!&rdquo; At the next one he calls the name of another canoe: &ldquo;O
Gumawora, thy heap, there! O Gumawora O!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes thus over all the heaps, allotting each one to a canoe.
After that is finished, some of the younger boys of each canoe go and
fetch their heap. This is brought to their fire, the meat is roasted,
and the yams, the sugar cane and betel-nut distributed among the crew,
who presently sit down and eat, each group by itself. We see that,
although the <i lang="kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i> is responsible for
the feast, and receives from the natives all the credit for it, his
active part in the proceedings is a small one, and it is more nominal
than real. On such occasions it would <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb214" href="#pb214" name="pb214">214</a>]</span>perhaps be incorrect
to call him &lsquo;master of ceremonies,&rsquo; although he assumes
this r&ocirc;le, as we shall see, on other occasions. Nevertheless, for
the natives, he is the centre of the proceedings. His people do all the
work there is to be done, and in certain cases he would be referred to
for a decision, on some question of etiquette.</p>
<p>After the meal is over, the natives rest, chew betel-nut and smoke,
looking across the water towards the setting sun&mdash;it is now
probably late in the afternoon&mdash;towards where, above the moored
canoes, which rock and splash in the shallows, there float the faint
silhouettes of the mountains. These are the distant <i lang=
"kij">Koya</i>, the high hills in the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux and
Amphletts, to which the elder natives have often already sailed, and of
which the younger have heard so many times in myth, tales and magical
spells. Kula conversations will predominate on such occasions, and
names of distant partners, and personal names of specially valuable
<i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> will punctuate the conversation and
make it very obscure to those not initiated into the technicalities and
historical traditions of the Kula. Recollections how a certain big
spondylus necklace passed a couple of years ago through Sinaketa, how
So-and-so handed it to So-and-so in Kiriwina, who again gave it to one
of his partners in Kitava (all the personal names of course being
mentioned) and how it went from there to Woodlark Island, where its
traces become lost&mdash;such reminiscences lead to conjectures as to
where the necklace might now be, and whether there is a chance of
meeting it in Dobu. Famous exchanges are cited, quarrels over Kula
grievances, cases in which a man was killed by magic for his too
successful dealings in the Kula, are told one after the other, and
listened to with never failing interest. The younger men amuse
themselves perhaps with less serious discussions about the dangers
awaiting them on the sea, about the fierceness of the witches and
dreadful beings in the <i lang="kij">Koya</i>, while many a young
Trobriander would be warned at this stage of the unaccommodating
attitude of the women in Dobu, and of the fierceness of their men
folk.</p>
<p>After nightfall a number of small fires are lit on the beach. The
stiff pandanus mats, folded in the middle, are put over each sleeper so
as to form a small roof, and the whole crowd settle down for the night.

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Next morning, if there is a fair wind, or a hope of
it, the natives are up very early, and all are feverishly active. Some
fix up the masts and rigging of the canoes, doing it much more
thoroughly and carefully than it was done on the previous morning,
since there may be a whole day&rsquo;s sailing ahead of them perhaps
with a strong wind, and under dangerous conditions. After all is done,
the sails ready to be hoisted, the various ropes put into good trim,
all the members of the crew sit at their posts, and each canoe waits
some few yards from the beach for its <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>
(master of the canoe). He remains on shore, in order to perform one of
the several magical rites which, at this stage of sailing, break
through the purely matter-of-fact events. All these rites of magic are
directed towards the canoes, making them speedy, seaworthy and safe. In
the first rite, some leaves are medicated by the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> as he squats over them on the beach and recites a
formula. The wording of this indicates that it is a speed magic, and
this is also the explicit statement of the natives.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Kadumiyala Spell.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In this spell, the flying fish and the jumping gar
fish are invoked at the beginning. Then the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>
urges his canoe to fly at its bows and at its stern. Then, in a long
<i lang="kij">tapwana</i>, he repeats a word signifying the magical
imparting of speed, and with the names of the various parts of the
canoe. The last part runs: &ldquo;The canoe flies, the canoe flies in
the morning, the canoe flies at sunrise, the canoe flies like a flying
witch,&rdquo; ending up with the onomatopoetic words &ldquo;<i lang=
"kij">Saydidi, tatata, numsa</i>,&rdquo; which represent the flapping
of pandanus streamers in the wind, or as others say, the noises made by
the flying witches, as they move through the air on a stormy night.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>After having uttered this spell into the leaves, the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> gives them to one of the <i lang="kij">usagelu</i>
(members of the crew), who, wading round the <i lang="kij">waga</i>,
rubs with them first the <i lang="kij">dobwana</i>, &lsquo;head&rsquo;
of the canoe, then the middle of its body, and finally its <i lang=
"kij">u&rsquo;ula</i> (basis). Proceeding round on the side of the
outrigger, he rubs the &lsquo;head&rsquo; again. It may be remembered
here that, with the native canoes, fore and aft in the sailing sense
are interchangeable, since the canoe must sail having always the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href="#pb216" name=
"pb216">216</a>]</span>wind on its outrigger side, and it often has to
change stern to bows. But standing on a canoe so that the outrigger is
on the left hand, and the body of the canoe on the right, a native will
call the end of the canoe in front of him its head (<i lang=
"kij">dabwana</i>), and that behind, its basis (<i lang=
"kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>).</p>
<p>After this is over, the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> enters the canoe,
the sail is hoisted, and the canoe rushes ahead. Now two or three
pandanus streamers which had previously been medicated in the village
by the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> are tied to the rigging, and to the
mast. The following is the spell which had been said over them:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Bisila Spell.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Bora&rsquo;i, Bora&rsquo;i (a mythical name).
Bora&rsquo;i flies, it will fly; Bora&rsquo;i Bora&rsquo;i,
Bora&rsquo;i stands up, it will stand up. In company with
Bora&rsquo;i&mdash;<i lang="kij">sidididi</i>. Break through your
passage in Kadimwatu, pierce through thy Promontory of Salamwa. Go and
attach your pandanus streamer in Salamwa, go and ascend the slope of
Loma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lift up the body of my canoe; its body is like floating
gossamer, its body is like dry banana leaf, its body is like
fluff.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a definite association in the minds of the natives between
the pandanus streamers, with which they usually decorate mast, rigging
and sail, and the speed of the canoe. The decorative effect of the
floating strips of pale, glittering<a id="xd26e7507" name=
"xd26e7507"></a> yellow is indeed wonderful, when the speed of the
canoe makes them flutter in the wind. Like small banners of some stiff,
golden fabric they envelope the sail and rigging with light, colour and
movement.</p>
<p>The pandanus streamers, and especially their trembling, are a
definite characteristic of Trobriand culture (see <a href="#pl29">Plate
XXIX</a>). In some of their dances, the natives use long, bleached
ribbons of pandanus, which the men hold in both hands, and set
a-flutter while they dance. To do this well is one of the main
achievements of a brilliant artist. On many festive occasions the
<i lang="kij">bisila</i> (pandanus streamers) are tied to houses on
poles for decoration. They are thrust into armlets and belts as
personal ornaments. The <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> (valuables)
when prepared for the Kula, are decorated with strips of <i lang=
"kij">bisila</i>. In the Kula a chief will send to some distant partner
a <i lang="kij">bisila</i> streamer over which a special spell has been
recited, and this will make the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb217"
href="#pb217" name="pb217">217</a>]</span>partner eager to bestow
valuables on the sender. As we saw, a broad <i lang="kij">bisila</i>
streamer is attached to the canoe of a <i lang=
"kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i> as his badge of honour. The flying witches
(<i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>) are supposed to use pandanus streamers
in order to acquire speed and levitation in their nightly flights
through the air.</p>
<p>After the magical pandanus strips have been tied to the rigging,
beside the non-magical, purely ornamental ones, the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> sits at the <i lang="kij">veva</i> rope, the sheet
by which the sail is extended to the wind, and moving it to and fro he
recites a spell.</p>

"#n217.1" name="n217.1src">1</a> Then the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>
says: &ldquo;I shall treat my canoe magically in its middle part, I
shall treat it in its body. I shall take my <i lang="kij">butia</i>
(flower wreath), of the sweet-scented flowers. I shall put it on the
head of my canoe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then a lengthy middle strophe is recited, in which all the parts of
a canoe are named with two verbs one after the other. The verbs are:
&ldquo;To wreathe the canoe in a ritual manner,&rdquo; and &ldquo;to
paint it red in a ritual manner.&rdquo; The prefix <i lang=
"kij">bo-</i>, added to the verbs, has been here translated, &ldquo;in
a ritual manner.&rdquo;<a class="pseudonoteref" href=
"#n217.1">1</a></p>
<p>The spell ends by a conclusion similar to that of many other canoe
formul&aelig;, &ldquo;My canoe, thou art like a whirlwind, like a
vanishing shadow! Disappear in the distance, become like mist,
avaunt!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>These are the three usual rites for the sake of speed at the
beginning of the journey. If the canoe remains slow, however, an
auxiliary rite is performed; a piece of dried banana leaf is put
between the gunwale and one of the inner frame sticks of the canoe, and
a spell is recited over it. After that, they beat both ends of the
canoe with this banana leaf. If the canoe is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb218" href="#pb218" name=
"pb218">218</a>]</span>still heavy, and lags behind the others, a piece
of <i lang="kij">kuleya</i> (cooked and stale yam) is put on a mat, and
the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> medicates it with a spell which
transfers the heaviness to the yam. The spell here recited is the same
one which we met when the heavy log was being pulled into the village.
The log was then beaten with a bunch of grass, accompanied by the
recital of the spell, and then this bunch was thrown away.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e7606src" href="#xd26e7606" name="xd26e7606src">2</a>
In this case the piece of yam which has taken on the heaviness of the
canoe is thrown overboard. Sometimes, however, even this is of no
avail. The <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> then seats himself on the
platform next to the steersman, and utters a spell over a piece of
coco-nut husk, which is thrown into the water. This rite, called
<i lang="kij">Bisiboda patile</i> is a piece of evil-magic (<i lang=
"kij">bulubwalata</i>), intended to keep all the other canoes back. If
that does not help, the natives conclude that some taboos pertaining to
the canoe might have been broken, and perhaps the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> may feel some misgivings regarding the conduct of
his wife or wives. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb219" href="#pb219"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now at last the Kula expedition is properly set going.
The canoes are started on a long stage, before them the sea-arm of
Pilolu, stretching between the Trobriands and the
d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux. On the North, this portion of the sea is bounded
by the Archipelago of the Trobriands, that is, by the islands of
Vakuta, Boyowa and Kayleula, joining in the west on to the scattered
belt of the Lousan&ccedil;ay Islands. On the east, a long submerged
reef runs from the southern end of Vakuta to the Amphletts, forming an
extended barrier to sailing, but affording little protection from the
eastern winds and seas. In the South, this barrier links on to the
Amphletts, which together with the Northern coast of Fergusson and
Goodenough, form the Southern shore of Pilolu. To the West, Pilolu
opens up into the seas between the mainland of New Guinea and the
Bismarck Archipelago. In fact, what the natives designate by the name
of Pilolu is nothing else but the enormous basin of the
Lousan&ccedil;ay Lagoon, the largest coral atoll in the world. To the
natives, the name of Pilolu is full of emotional associations, drawn
from magic and myth; it is connected with the experiences of past
generations, told by the old men round the village fires and with
adventure personally lived through.</p>
<p>As the Kula adventurers speed along with filled sails, the shallow
Lagoon of the Trobriands soon falls away behind; the dull green waters,
sprinkled with patches of brown where seaweed grows high and rank, and
lit up here and there with spots of bright emerald where a shallow
bottom of clean sand shines through, give place to a deeper sea of
strong green hue. The low strip of land, which surrounds the Trobriand
Lagoon in a wide sweep, thins away and dissolves in the haze, and
before them the southern mountains rise higher and higher. On a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb220" href="#pb220" name=
"pb220">220</a>]</span>clear day, these are visible even from the
Trobriands. The neat outlines of the Amphletts stand diminutive, yet
firmer and more material, against the blue silhouettes of the higher
mountains behind. These, like a far away cloud are draped in wreaths of
cumuli, almost always clinging to their summits. The nearest of them,
Koyatabu&mdash;the mountain of the taboo&mdash;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e7640src" href="#xd26e7640" name="xd26e7640src">1</a> on the North
end of Fergusson Island, a slim, somewhat tilted pyramid, forms a most
alluring beacon, guiding the mariners due South. To the right of it, as
we look towards the South-West, a broad, bulky mountain, the
Koyabwaga&rsquo;u&mdash;mountain of the sorcerers&mdash;marks the
North-western corner of Fergusson Island. The mountains on Goodenough
Island are visible only in very clear weather, and then very
faintly.</p>
<p>Within a day or two, these disembodied, misty forms are to assume
what for the Trobrianders seems marvellous shape and enormous bulk.
They are to surround the Kula traders with their solid walls of
precipitous rock and green jungle, furrowed with deep ravines and
streaked with racing water-courses. The Trobrianders will sail deep,
shaded bays, resounding with the, to them unknown, voice of waterfalls;
with the weird cries of strange birds which never visit the Trobriands,
such as the laughing of the kookooburra (laughing jackass), and the
melancholy call of the South Sea crow. The sea will change its colour
once more, become pure blue, and beneath its transparent waters, a
marvellous world of multi-coloured coral, fish and seaweed will unfold
itself, a world which, through a strange geographical irony, the
inhabitants of a coral island hardly ever can see at home, and must
come to this volcanic region to discover.</p>
<p>In these surroundings, they will find also wonderful, heavy, compact
stones of various colours and shapes, whereas at home the only stone is
the insipid, white, dead coral. Here they can see, besides many types
of granite and basalt and volcanic tuff, specimens of black obsidian,
with its sharp edges and metallic ring, and sites full of red and
yellow ochre. Besides big hills of volcanic ash, they will behold hot
springs boiling up periodically. Of all these marvels the young
Trobriander hears tales, and sees samples brought back to his country,
and there is no <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb221" href="#pb221"
name="pb221">221</a>]</span>doubt that it is for him a wonderful
experience to find himself amongst them for the first time, and that
afterwards he eagerly seizes every opportunity that offers to sail
again to the Koya. Thus the landscape now before them is a sort of
promised land, a country spoken of in almost legendary tone.</p>
<p>And indeed the scenery here, on the borderland of the two different
worlds, is singularly impressive. Sailing away from the Trobriands on
my last expedition, I had to spend two days, weatherbound, on a small
sandbank covered with a few pandanus trees, about midway between the
Trobriands and the Amphletts. A darkened sea lay to the North, big
thunderclouds hanging over where I knew there was the large flat island
of Boyowa&mdash;the Trobriands. To the South, against a clearer sky,
were the abrupt forms of the mountains, scattered over half of the
horizon. The scenery seemed saturated with myth and legendary tales,
with the strange adventures, hopes and fears of generations of native
sailors. On this sandbank they had often camped, when becalmed or
threatened with bad weather. On such an island, the great mythical
hero, Kasabwaybwayreta stopped, and was marooned by his companions,
only to escape through the sky. Here again a mythical canoe once
halted, in order to be re-caulked. As I sat there, looking towards the
Southern mountains, so clearly visible, yet so inaccessible, I realised
what must be the feelings of the Trobrianders, desirous to reach the
Koya, to meet the strange people, and to <i lang="kij">kula</i> with
them, a desire made perhaps even more acute by a mixture of fear. For
there, to the west of the Amphletts, they see the big bay of Gabu,
where once the crews of a whole fleet of Trobriand canoes were killed
and eaten by the inhabitants of unknown villages, in attempting to
<i lang="kij">kula</i> with them. And stories are also told of single
canoes, drifted apart from the fleet and cast against the northern
shore of Fergusson Island, of which all the crew perished at the hands
of the cannibals. There are also legends of some inexperienced natives,
who, visiting the neighbourhood of Deyde&rsquo;i and arriving at the
crystal water in the big stone basins there, plunged in, to meet a
dreadful death in the almost boiling pool.</p>
<p>But though the legendary dangers on the distant shores may appall
the native imagination, the perils of actual sailing are even more
real. The sea over which they travel is seamed with reefs, studded with
sandbanks and coral rocks awash. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb222"
href="#pb222" name="pb222">222</a>]</span>And though in fair weather
these are not so dangerous to a canoe as to a European boat, yet they
are bad enough. The main dangers of native sailing, however, lie in the
helplessness of a canoe. As we have said before, it cannot sail close
to the wind, and therefore cannot beat. If the wind comes round, the
canoe has to turn and retrace its course. This is very unpleasant, but
not necessarily dangerous. If, however, the wind drops, and the canoe
just happens to be in one of the strong tides, which run anything
between three and five knots, or if it becomes disabled, and makes
leeway at right angles to its course, the situation becomes dangerous.
To the West, there lies the open sea, and once far out there, the canoe
would have slender chances of ever returning. To the East, there runs
the reef, on which in heavy weather a native canoe would surely be
smashed. In May, 1918, a Dobuan canoe, returning home a few days after
the rest of the fleet, was caught by a strong South-Easterly wind, so
strong that it had to give up its course, and make North-West to one of
the Lousan&ccedil;ay Islands. It had been given up as lost, when in
August it came back with a chance blow of the North-Westerly wind. It
had had, however, a narrow escape in making the small island. Had it
been blown further West, it would never have reached land at all.</p>
<p>There exist other tales of lost canoes, and it is a wonder that
accidents are not more frequent, considering the conditions under which
they have to sail. Sailing has to be done, so to speak, on straight
lines across the sea. Once they deviate from this course, all sorts of
dangers crop up. Not only that, but they must sail between fixed points
on the land. For, and this of course refers to the olden days, if they
had to go ashore, anywhere but in the district of a friendly tribe, the
perils which met them were almost as bad as those of reefs and sharks.
If the sailors missed the friendly villages of the Amphletts and of
Dobu, everywhere else they would meet with extermination. Even
nowadays, though the danger of being killed would be
smaller&mdash;perhaps not absolutely non-existent&mdash;yet the natives
would feel very uncomfortable at the idea of landing in a strange
district, fearing not only death by violence, but even more by evil
magic. Thus, as the natives sail across Pilolu, only very small sectors
of their horizon present a safe goal for their journey. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb223" href="#pb223" name="pb223">223</a>]</span></p>
<p>On the East, indeed, beyond the dangerous barrier reef, there is a
friendly horizon, marked for them by the Marshall Bennett Islands, and
Woodlark, the country known under the term Omuyuwa. To the South, there
is the Koya, also known as the land of the <i lang="kij">kinana</i>, by
which name the natives of the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux and the Amphletts
are known generically. But to the South-West and West there is the deep
open sea (<i lang="kij">bebega</i>), and beyond that, lands inhabited
by tailed people, and by people with wings, of whom very little more is
known. To the North, beyond the reef of small coral islands, lying off
the Trobriands, there are two countries, Kokopawa and Kaytalugi.
Kokopawa is peopled with ordinary men and women, who walk about naked,
and are great gardeners. Whether this country corresponds to the South
coast of New Britain, where people really are without any clothing, it
would be difficult to say.</p>
<p>The other country, Kaytalugi, is a land of women only, in which no
man can survive. The women who live there are beautiful, big and
strong, and they walk about naked, and with their bodily hair unshaven
(which is contrary to the Trobriand custom). They are extremely
dangerous to any man through the unbounded violence of their passion.
The natives never tire of describing graphically how such women would
satisfy their sensuous lust, if they got hold of some luckless,
shipwrecked man. No one could survive, even for a short time, the
amorous yet brutal attacks of these women. The natives compare this
treatment to that customary at the <i lang="kij">yousa</i>, the
orgiastic mishandling of any man, caught at certain stages of female
communal labour in Boyowa (cf. <a href="#div2.2">Chapter II, Division
II</a>). Not even the boys born on this island of Kaytalugi can survive
a tender age. It must be remembered the natives see no need for male
co-operation in continuing the race. Thus the women propagate the race,
although every male needs must come to an untimely end before he can
become a man.</p>
<p>None the less, there is a legend that some men from the village of
Kaulagu, in eastern Boyowa, were blown in their canoe far North from
the easterly course of a Kula expedition, and were stranded on the
coast of Kaytalugi. There, having survived the first reception, they
were apportioned individually and married. Having repaired their canoe,
ostensibly for the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb224" href="#pb224"
name="pb224">224</a>]</span>sake of bringing some fish to their wives,
one night they put food and water into it, and secretly sailed away. On
their return to their own village, they found their women married to
other men. However, such things never end tragically in the Trobriands.
As soon as their rightful lords reappeared their women came back to
them. Among other things these men brought to Boyowa a variety of
banana called <i lang="kij">usikela</i>, not known before.</p>

<p class="first">Returning again to our Kula party, we see that, in
journeying across Pilolu, they move within the narrow confines of
familiar sailing ground, surrounded on all sides both by real dangers
and by lands of imaginary horrors. On their track, however, the natives
never go out of sight of land, and in the event of mist or rain, they
can always take sufficient bearings to enable them to make for the
nearest sand-bank or island. This is never more than some six miles
off, a distance which, should the wind have dropped, may even be
reached by paddling.</p>

"kij">kewo&uacute;</i>canoe to the left.</p>
</div>
<p>Another thing that also makes their sailing not so dangerous as one
would imagine, is the regularity of the winds in this part of the
world. As a rule, in each of the two main seasons, there is one
prevailing direction of wind, which does not shift more than within
some ninety degrees. Thus, in the dry season, from May to October, the
trade wind blows almost incessantly from the South-East or South,
moving sometimes to the North-East, but never beyond that<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e7730" title="Not in source">.</span> As a matter of
fact, however, this season, just because of the constancy of the wind,
does not lend itself very well to native sailing. For although with
this wind it is easy to sail from South to North, or East to West, it
is impossible to retrace the course, and as the wind often blows for
months without veering, the natives prefer to do their sailings between
the seasons, or in the time when the monsoon blows. Between the
seasons&mdash;November, December or March and April&mdash;the winds are
not so constant, in fact they shift from one position on the compass to
another. On the other hand, there is very seldom a strong blow at this
time, and so this is the ideal season for sailing<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7733" title="Not in source">.</span> In the hot summer months,
December till March, the monsoon blows from the North-West or
South-West, less regularly than a trade wind, but <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb225" href="#pb225" name=
"pb225">225</a>]</span>often culminating in violent storms which almost
always come from the North-West. Thus the two strong winds to be met in
these seas come from definite directions, and this minimises the
danger. The natives also as a rule are able to foretell a day or two
beforehand the approach of a squall. Rightly or wrongly, they associate
the strength of the North-Westerly gales with the phases of the
moon.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a good deal of magic to make wind blow or to
put it down. Like many other forms of magic, wind magic is localised in
villages. The inhabitants of Simsim, the biggest village in the
Lousan&ccedil;ay Islands, and the furthest North-Westerly settlement of
this district, are credited with the ability of controlling the
North-Westerly wind, perhaps through association with their
geographical position. Again, the control over the South-Easterly wind
is granted to the inhabitants of Kitava, lying to the East of Boyowa.
The Simsim people control all the winds which blow habitually during
the rainy season, that is the winds on the western side of the compass,
from North to South. The other half can be worked by the Kitavan
spells.</p>
<p>Many men in Boyowa have learnt both spells and they practise the
magic. The spells are chanted broadcast into the wind, without any
other ritual. It is an impressive spectacle to walk through a village,
during one of the devastating gales, which always arise at night and
during which people leave their huts and assemble in cleared spaces.
They are afraid the wind may lift their dwellings off the ground, or
uproot a tree which might injure them in falling, an accident which
actually did happen a year or two ago in Wawela, killing the
chief&rsquo;s wife. Through the darkness from the doors of some of the
huts, and from among the huddled groups, there resound loud voices,
chanting, in a penetrating sing-song, the spells for abating the force
of the wind. On such occasions, feeling myself somewhat nervous, I was
deeply impressed by this persistent effort of frail, human voice,
fraught with deep belief, pitting itself so feebly against the
monotonous, overpowering force of the wind.</p>
<p>Taking the bearing by sight, and helped by the uniformity of winds,
the natives have no need of even the most elementary knowledge of
navigation. Barring accidents they never have to direct their course by
the stars. Of these, they know certain Outstanding constellations,
sufficient to indicate for them the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb226" href="#pb226" name="pb226">226</a>]</span>direction, should
they need it. They have names for the Pleiades, for Orion, for the
Southern Cross, and they also recognise a few constellations of their
own construction. Their knowledge of the stars, as we have mentioned
already in <a href="#div2.5">Chapter II, Division V</a>, is localised
in the village of Wawela, where it is handed over in the maternal line
of the chiefs of the village.</p>
<p>In order to understand better the customs and problems of sailing, a
few words must be said about the technique of managing a canoe. As we
have said before, the wind must always strike the craft, on the
outrigger side, so the sailing canoe is always tilted with its float
raised, and the platform slanting towards the body of the canoe. This
makes it necessary for it to be able to change bows and stern at will;
for imagine that a canoe going due South, has to sail with a
North-Easterly wind, then the <i lang="kij">lamina</i> (outrigger) must
be on the left hand, and the canoe sails with what the natives call its
&ldquo;head&rdquo; forward. Now imagine that the wind turns to the
North-West. Should this happen in a violent squall, without warning,
the canoe would be at once submerged. But, as such a change would be
gradual, barring accidents, the natives could easily cope with it. The
mast, which is tied at the fourth cross-pole (<i lang=
"kij">ri&rsquo;u</i>) from the temporary bows of the canoe, would be
unbound, the canoe would be turned 180 degrees around, so that its head
would now form the stern, its <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>
(foundation) would face South, and become its bows, and the platform
would be to our right, facing West. The mast would be attached again to
the fourth cross-pole (<i lang="kij">ri&rsquo;u</i>), from the <i lang=
"kij">u&rsquo;ula</i> end, the sail hoisted, and the canoe would glide
along with the wind striking it again on its outrigger side, but having
changed bows to stern (see <a href="#pl41">Plate XLI</a>).</p>
<p>The natives have a set of nautical expressions to describe the
various operations of changing mast, of trimming the sail, of paying
out the sheet rope, of shifting the sail, so that it stands up with its
bottom end high, and its tip touching the canoe, or else letting it lie
with both boom and gaff almost horizontal. And they have definite rules
as to how the various man&oelig;uvres should be carried out, according
to the strength of the wind, and to the quarter on which it strikes the
canoe. They have four expressions denoting a following wind, wind
striking the outrigger beam, wind striking the canoe from the <i lang=
"kij">katala</i> (built-out body), and wind striking the canoe on the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227" name=
"pb227">227</a>]</span>outrigger side close to the direction of
sailing. There is no point, however, in adducing this native
terminology here, as we shall not any further refer to it; it is enough
to know that they have got definite rules, and means of expressing
them, with regard to the handling of a canoe.</p>
<p>It has been often remarked here, that the Trobriand canoes cannot
sail close to the wind. They are very light, and shallow, and have very
little water board, giving a small resistance against making lee-way. I
think that this is also the reason, why they need two men to do the
steering for the steering oars act as lee-boards. One of the men wields
a big, elongated steering oar, called <i lang="kij">kuriga</i>. He sits
at the stern, of course, in the body of the canoe. The other man
handles a smaller steering paddle, leaf-shaped, yet with a bigger blade
than the paddling oars; it is called <i lang="kij">viyoyu</i>. He sits
at the stern end of the platform, and does the steering through the
sticks of the <i lang="kij">pitapatile</i> (platform).</p>
<p>The other working members of the crew are the man at the sheet, the
<i lang="kij">tokwabila veva</i>, as he is called, who has to let out
the <i lang="kij">veva</i> or pull it in, according as the wind shifts
and varies in strength.</p>
<p>Another man, as a rule, stands in the bows of the ship on the
look-out, and if necessary, has to climb the mast in order to trim the
rigging. Or again, he would have to bale the water from time to time,
as this always leaks through, or splashes into the canoe. Thus four men
are enough to man a canoe, though usually the functions of the baler
and the man on the look-out and at the mast are divided.</p>
<p>When the wind drops, the men have to take to the small, leaf-shaped
paddles, while one, as a rule, wields a pulling oar. But in order to
give speed to a heavy <i lang="kij">masawa</i> canoe, at least ten men
would have to paddle and pull. As we shall see, on certain ceremonial
occasions, the canoes have to be propelled by paddling, for instance
when they approach their final destination, after having performed the
great <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> magic. When they arrive at a halting
place, the canoes, if necessary, are beached. As a rule, however, the
heavily loaded canoes on a Kula expedition, would be secured by both
mooring and anchoring, according to the bottom. On muddy bottoms, such
as that of the Trobriand Lagoon, a long stick would be thrust into the
slime, and one end of the canoe lashed to it. From the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>other, a heavy stone, tied with a rope, would be
thrown down as an anchor. Over a hard, rocky bottom, the anchor stone
alone is used.</p>
<p>It can be easily understood that with such craft, and with such
limitations in sailing, there are many real dangers which threaten the
natives. If the wind is too strong, and the sea becomes too rough, a
canoe may not be able to follow its course, and making lee-way, or even
directly running before the wind, it may be driven into a quarter where
there is no landfall to be made, or from where at best there is no
returning at that season. This is what happened to the Dobuan boat
mentioned before. Or else, a canoe becalmed and seized by the tide may
not be able to make its way by means of paddling. Or in stormy weather,
it may be smashed on rocks and sandbanks, or even unable to withstand
the impact of waves. An open craft like a native canoe easily fills
with sea water, and, in a heavy rain-storm, with rain water. In a calm
sea this is not very dangerous, for the wooden canoe does not sink;
even if swamped, the water can be baled out and the canoe floats up.
But in rough weather, a water-logged canoe loses its buoyancy and gets
broken up. Last and not least, there is the danger of the canoe being
pressed into the water, outrigger first, should the wind strike it on
the opposite side. With so many real dangers around it, it is a
marvellous thing, and to the credit of native seamanship, that
accidents are comparatively rare.</p>
<p>We now know about the crew of the canoe and the different functions
which every man has to fulfil. Remembering what has been said in
<a href="#div4.5">Chapter IV, Division V</a>, about the sociological
division of functions in sailing, we can visualise concretely the craft
with all its inmates, as it sails on the Pilolu; the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> usually sits near the mast in the compartment called
<i lang="kij">kayguya&rsquo;u</i>. With him perhaps is one of his sons
or young relatives, while another boy remains in the bows, near the
conch-shell ready to sound it, whenever the occasion arises. Thus are
employed the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> and the <i lang=
"kij">dodo&rsquo;u</i> (small boys). The <i lang="kij">usagelu</i> or
members of the crew, some four or five strong, are each at his post,
with perhaps one supernumerary to assist at any emergency, where the
task would require it. On the platform are lounging some of the
<i lang="kij">silasila</i>, the youths not yet employed in any work,
and not participating in the Kula, but there for their pleasure, and to
learn how to manage a boat (see <a href="#pl40">Plate XL</a>).</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">All these people have not only special posts and modes
of occupation assigned to them, but they have also to keep certain
rules. The canoe on a Kula expedition, is surrounded by taboos, and
many observances have to be strictly kept, else this or that might go
wrong. Thus it is not allowed to &lsquo;point to objects with the
hand&rsquo; (<i lang="kij">yosala yamada</i>), or those who do it will
become sick. A new canoe has many prohibitions <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e7846" title="Source: cannected">connected</span> with it, which
are called <i lang="kij">bomala wayugo</i> (the taboos of the lashing
creeper). Eating and drinking are not allowed in a new canoe except
after sunset. The breaking of this taboo would make the canoe very
slow. On a very quick <i lang="kij">waga</i> this rule might perhaps be
disregarded, especially if one of the young boys were hungry or
thirsty. The <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> would then bale in some
sea-water, pour it over one of the lashings of the creeper with the
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;I sprinkle thy eye, O <i lang=
"kij">kudayuri</i> creeper, so that our crew might eat.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>After that, he would give the boy something to eat and drink.
Besides this eating and drinking taboo, on a new <i lang="kij">waga</i>
the other physiological needs must not be satisfied. In case of urgent
necessity, a man jumps into the water, holding to one of the cross
sticks of the outrigger, or if it were a small boy, he is lowered into
the water by one of the elders. This taboo, if broken, would also make
the canoe slow. These two taboos, however, as was said, are kept only
on a new <i lang="kij">waga</i>, that is on such a one which either
sails for the first time, or else has been relashed and repainted
before this trip. The taboos are in all cases not operative on the
return journey. Women are not allowed to enter a new <i lang=
"kij">waga</i> before it sails. Certain types of yams may not be
carried on a canoe, which has been lashed with the rites of one of the
<i lang="kij">wayugo</i> magical systems. There are several systems of
this magic (compare <a href="#div17.7">Chapter XVII, Division VII</a>)
and each has got its specific taboos. These last taboos are to be kept
right through the sailing. On account of a magic to be described in the
next chapter, the magic of safety as it might be called, a canoe has to
be kept free from contact with earth, sand and stones. Hence the
natives of Sinaketa do not beach their canoes if they can possibly
avoid it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230" href="#pb230" name=
"pb230">230</a>]</span></p>
<p>Among the specific taboos of the Kula, called <i lang="kij">bomala
lilava</i> (taboos of the magical bundle) there is a strict rule
referring to the entering of a canoe. This must not be entered from any
other point but on the <i lang="kij">vitovaria</i>, that is, the front
side of the platform, facing the mast. A native has to scale the
platform at this place, then, crouching low, pass to the back or front,
and there descend into the body of the canoe, or sit down where he is.
The compartment facing the <i lang="kij">lilava</i> (magical bundle) is
filled out with other trade goods. In front of it sits the chief,
behind it the man who handles the sheets. The natives have special
expressions which denote the various manners of illicitly entering a
canoe, and, in some of the canoe exorcisms, these expressions are used
to undo the evil effects of the breaking of these taboos. Other
prohibitions, which the natives call the taboo of the <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i>, though not associated with the <i lang=
"kij">lilava</i>, are those which do not allow of using flower wreaths,
red ornaments, or red flowers in decorating the canoe or the bodies of
the crew. The red colour of such ornaments is, according to native
belief, magically incompatible with the aim of the expedition&mdash;the
acquisition of the red spondylus necklaces. Also, yams may not be
roasted on the outward journey, while later on, in Dobu, no local food
may be eaten, and the natives have to subsist on their own provisions,
until the first Kula gifts have been received.</p>
<p>There are, besides, definite rules, referring to the behaviour of
one canoe towards another, but these vary considerably with the
different villages. In Sinaketa, such rules are very few; no fixed
sequence is observed in the sailing order of the canoes, anyone of them
can start first, and if one of them is swifter it may pass any of the
others, even that of a chief. This, however, has to be done so that the
slower canoe is not passed on the outrigger side. Should this happen,
the transgressing canoe has to give the other one a peace offering
(<i lang="kij">lula</i>), because it has broken a <i lang="kij">bomala
lilava</i>, it has offended the magical bundle.</p>
<p>There is one interesting point with regard to priorities in
Sinaketa, and to describe this we must hark back to the subject of
canoe-building and launching. One of the sub-clans of the Lukwasisiga
clan, the Tolabwaga sub-clan, have the right of priority in all the
successive operations of piecing together, lashing, caulking, and
painting of their canoes. All these stages of building and all the
magic must first be done on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231" href=
"#pb231" name="pb231">231</a>]</span>the Tolabwaga canoe, and this
canoe is also the first to be launched. Only afterwards, the
chief&rsquo;s and the commoners&rsquo; canoes may follow. A correct
observance of this rule &lsquo;keeps the sea clean&rsquo; (<i lang=
"kij">imilakatile bwarita</i>). If it were broken, and the chiefs had
their canoes built or launched before the Tolabwaga, the Kula would not
be successful.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;We go to Dobu, no pig, no <i lang=
"kij">soulava</i> necklace is given. We would tell the chiefs:
&lsquo;Why have you first made your canoes? The ancestor spirits have
turned against us, for we have broken the old
custom!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Once at sea, however, the chiefs are first again, in theory at
least, for in practice the swiftest canoe may sail first.</p>
<p>In the sailing custom of Vakuta, the other South Boyowan community,
who make the Kula with the Dobu, a sub-clan of the Lukwasisiga clan,
called Tolawaga, have the privilege of priority in all the
canoe-building operations. While at sea, they also retain one
prerogative, denied to all the others: the man who steers with the
smaller oar, the <i lang="kij">tokabina viyoyu</i>, is allowed
permanently to stand up on the platform. As the natives put it,</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;This is the sign of the Tolawaga (sub-clan) of
Vakuta: wherever we see a man standing up at the <i lang=
"kij">viyoyu</i>, we say: &lsquo;there sails the canoe of the
Tolawaga!&rsquo;&ldquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The greatest privileges, however, granted to a sub-clan in sailing
are those which are to be found in Kavataria. This fishing and sailing
community from the North shore of the Lagoon makes distant and
dangerous sailings to the North-Western end of Fergusson Island. These
expeditions for sago, betel-nut, and pigs will be described in <a href=
"#ch21">Chapter XXI</a>. Their sea customs, however, have to be
mentioned here.</p>
<p>The Kulutula sub-clan of the Lukwasisiga clan enjoy all the same
privileges of priority in building, as the Tolabwaga and Tolawaga clans
in the southern villages, only in a still higher degree. For their
canoe has to pass each stage of construction on the first day, and only
the day after can the others follow. This refers even to launching, the
Kulutula canoe being launched one day, and on the next those of the
chiefs and commoners. When the moment of starting arrives, the Kulutula
canoe leaves the beach first, and during the sailing no one is allowed
to pass ahead of it. When they arrive at the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name=
"pb232">232</a>]</span>sandbanks or at an intermediate place in the
Amphletts, the Kulutula have to anchor first, and first go ashore and
make their camp ready. Only after that can the others follow. This
priority expires at the final point of destination. When they arrive at
the furthest Koya the Kulutula go ashore first, and they are the first
to be presented with the welcoming gift of the &lsquo;foreigner&rsquo;
(<i lang="kij">tokinana</i>). He receives them with a bunch of
betel-nut, which he beats against the head of the canoe, till the nuts
scatter. On the return journey, the Kulutula clan sink again into their
naturally inferior position.</p>
<p>It may be noted that all the three privileged sub-clans in the three
villages belong to the Lukwasisiga clan, and that the names of two of
them, Tolawaga, Tolabwaga have a striking resemblance to the word
<i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>, although these resemblances would have to
be tested by some stricter methods of etymological comparison, than I
have now at my disposal. The fact that these clans, under special
circumstances of sailing, resume what may be a lost superiority points
to an interesting historical survival. The name Kulutula is undoubtedly
identical with Kulutalu, which is an independent totemic clan in the
Eastern Marshall Bennetts and in Woodlark.<a class="noteref" id=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us return now to our Sinaketan fleet, moving
southwards along the barrier reef and sighting one small island after
the other. If they did not start very early from Muwa&mdash;and delay
is one of the characteristics of native life&mdash;and if they were not
favoured with a very good wind, they would probably have to put in at
one of the small sand islands, Legumatabu, Gabuwana or Yakum. Here, on
the western side, sheltered from the prevalent trade winds, there is a
diminutive lagoon, bounded by two natural breakwaters of coral reef
running from the Northern and Southern ends of the island. Fires are
lit on the clean, white sand, under the scraggy pandanus trees, and the
natives boil their yam food and the eggs of the wild sea fowl,
collected on the spot. When darkness closes in and the fires draw them
all into a circle, the Kula talk begins again. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb233" href="#pb233" name="pb233">233</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us listen to some such conversations, and try to steep ourselves
in the atmosphere surrounding this handful of natives, cast for a while
on to the narrow sandbank, far away from their homes, having to trust
only to their frail canoes on the long journey which faces them.
Darkness, the roar of surf breaking on the reef, the dry rattle of the
pandanus leaves in the wind, all produce a frame of mind in which it is
easy to believe in the dangers of witches and all the beings usually
hidden away, but ready to creep out at some special moment of horror.
The change of tone is unmistakable, when you get the natives to talk
about these things on such an occasion, from the calm, often
rationalistic way of treating them in broad daylight in an
Ethnographer&rsquo;s tent. Some of the most striking revelations I have
received of this side of native belief and psychology were made to me
on similar occasions. Sitting on a lonely beach in Sanaroa, surrounded
by a crew of Trobrianders, Dobuans, and a few local natives, I first
heard the story of the jumping stones. On a previous night, trying to
anchor off Gumasila in the Amphletts, we had been caught by a violent
squall, which tore one of our sails, and forced us to run before the
wind, on a dark night, in the pouring rain. Except for myself, all the
members of the crew saw clearly the flying witches in the form of a
flame at the mast head. Whether this was St. Elmo&rsquo;s fire I could
not judge, as I was in the cabin, seasick and indifferent to dangers,
witches, and even ethnographic revelations. Inspired by this incident,
my crew told me how this is, as a rule, a sign of disaster, how such a
light appeared a few years ago in a boat, which was sunk almost on the
same spot where the squall had caught us; but fortunately all were
saved. Starting from this, all sorts of dangers were spoken about, in a
tone of deep conviction, rendered perfectly sincere by the experiences
of the previous night, the surrounding darkness, and the difficulties
of the situation&mdash;for we had to repair our sail and again attempt
the difficult landing in the Amphletts.</p>
<p>I have always found that whenever natives are found under similar
circumstances, surrounded by the darkness and the imminent possibility
of danger, they naturally drift into a conversation about the various
things and beings into which the fears and apprehensions of generations
have traditionally crystallised. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb234"
href="#pb234" name="pb234">234</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus if we imagine that we listen to an account of the perils and
horrors of the seas, sitting round the fire at Yakum or Legumatabu, we
do not stray from reality. One of those who are specially versed in
tradition, and who love to tell a story, might refer to one of his own
experiences; or to a well-known case from the past, while others would
chime in, and comment, telling their own stories. General statements of
belief would be given, while the younger men would listen to the tales
so familiar, but always heard with renewed interest.</p>
<p>They would hear about an enormous octopus (<i lang="kij">kwita</i>)
which lies in wait for canoes, sailing over the open seas. It is not an
ordinary <i lang="kij">kwita</i> of exceptional size, but a special
one, so gigantic that it would cover a whole village with its body; its
arms are thick as coco-nut palms, stretching right across the sea. With
typical exaggeration, the natives will say: &lsquo;<i lang=
"kij">ikanubwadi Pilolu</i>,&rsquo; &hellip; &lsquo;he covers up all
the Pilolu&rsquo; (the sea-arm between the Trobriands and the
Amphletts). Its proper home is in the East, &lsquo;<i lang="kij">o
Muyuwa</i>,&rsquo; as the natives describe that region of sea and
islands, where also it is believed some magic is known against the
dreadful creature. Only seldom does it come to the waters between the
Trobriands and Amphletts, but there are people who have seen it there.
One of the old men of Sinaketa tells how, coming from Dobu, when he was
quite young, he sailed in a canoe ahead of the fleet, some canoes being
to the right and some to the left behind him. Suddenly from his canoe,
they saw the giant <i lang="kij">kwita</i> right in front of them.
Paralysed with fear, they fell silent, and the man himself, getting up
on the platform, by signs warned the other canoes of the danger. At
once they turned round, and the fleet divided into two, took big bends
in their course, and thus gave the octopus a wide berth. For woe to the
canoe caught by the giant <i lang="kij">kwita!</i> It would be held
fast, unable to move for days, till the crew, dying of hunger and
thirst, would decide to sacrifice one of the small boys of their
number. Adorned with valuables, he would be thrown overboard, and then
the <i lang="kij">kwita</i>, satisfied, would let go its hold of the
canoe, and set it free. Once a native, asked why a grown-up would not
be sacrificed on such an occasion, gave me the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;A grown-up man would not like it; a boy has got
no mind. We take him by force and throw him to the <i lang=
"kij">kwita</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb235" href="#pb235" name=
"pb235">235</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another danger threatening a canoe on the high seas, is a big,
special Rain, or Water falling from above, called <i lang=
"kij">Sinamatanoginogi</i>. When in rain and bad weather a canoe, in
spite of all the efforts to bale it out, fills with water, <i lang=
"kij">Sinamatanoginogi</i> strikes it from above and breaks it up.
Whether at the basis of this are the accidents with waterspouts, or
cloud-bursts or simply extremely big waves breaking up the canoe, it is
difficult to judge. On the whole, this belief is more easily accounted
for than the previous one.</p>
<p>The most remarkable of these beliefs is that there are big, live
stones, which lie in wait for sailing canoes, run after them, jump up
and smash them to pieces. Whenever the natives have reasons to be
afraid of them, all the members of the crew will keep silence, as
laughter and loud talk attracts them. Sometimes they can be seen, at a
distance, jumping out of the sea or moving on the water. In fact I have
had them pointed to me, sailing off Koyatabu, and although I could see
nothing, the natives, obviously, genuinely believed they saw them. Of
one thing I am certain, however, that there was no reef awash there for
miles around. The natives also know quite well that they are different
from any reefs or shallows, for the live stones move, and when they
perceive a canoe will pursue it, break it up on purpose and smash the
men. Nor would these expert fishermen ever confuse a jumping fish with
anything else, though in speaking of the stones they may compare them
to a leaping dolphin or stingaree.</p>
<p>There are two names given to such stones. One of them, <i lang=
"kij">nuwakekepaki</i>, applies to the stones met in the Dobuan seas.
The other, <i lang="kij">vineylida</i>, to those who live
&lsquo;<i lang="kij">o Muyuwa</i>.&rsquo; Thus, in the open seas, the
two spheres of culture meet, for the stones not only differ in name but
also in nature. The <i lang="kij">nuwakekepaki</i> are probably nothing
but malevolent stones. The <i lang="kij">vineylida</i> are inhabited by
witches, or according to others, by evil male beings.<a class="noteref"
id="xd26e8043src" href="#xd26e8043" name="xd26e8043src">3</a> Sometimes
a <i lang="kij">vineylida</i> will spring to the surface, and hold fast
the canoe, very much in the same manner as the giant octopus would do.
And here again offerings would have to be given. A folded mat would
first be thrown, in an attempt to deceive it; if this were of no avail,
a little boy would be anointed with coco-nut oil, adorned with
arm-shells and <i lang="kij">bagi</i> necklaces, and thrown over to the
evil stones. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb236" href="#pb236" name=
"pb236">236</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is difficult to realise what natural phenomena or actual
occurrences might be at the bottom of this belief, and the one of the
giant octopus. We shall presently meet with a cycle of beliefs
presenting the same striking features. We shall find a story told about
human behaviour mixed up with supernatural elements, laying down the
rules of what would happen, and how human beings would behave, in the
same matter of fact way, as if ordinary events of tribal life were
described. I shall have to comment on the psychology of these beliefs
in the next chapter, where also the story is told. Of all the dangerous
and frightful beings met with on a sailing expedition, the most
unpleasant, the best known and most dreaded are the flying witches, the
<i lang="kij">yoyova</i> or <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>. The former
name means a woman endowed with such powers, whereas <i lang=
"kij">mulukwausi</i> describes the second self of the woman, as it
flies disembodied through the air. Thus, for instance, they would say
that such and such a woman in Wawela is a <i lang="kij">yoyova</i>. But
sailing at night, one would have to be on the look out for <i lang=
"kij">mulukwausi</i>, among whom might possibly be the double of that
woman in Wawela. Very often, especially at moments when the speaker
would be under the influence of fear of these beings, the deprecating
euphemism&mdash;&lsquo;<i lang="kij">vivila</i>&rsquo; (women) would be
used. And probably our Boyowan mariners would speak of them thus in
their talk round the campfire, for fear of attracting them by sounding
their real name. Dangerous as they always are, at sea they become
infinitely more dreaded. For the belief is deep that in case of
shipwreck or mishap at sea, no real evil can befall the crows except by
the agency of the dreaded women.</p>
<p>As through their connection with shipwreck, they enter inevitably
into our narrative, it will be better to leave our Kula expedition on
the beach of Yakum in the midst of Pilolu, and to turn in the next
chapter to Kiriwinian ethnography and give there an account of the
natives&rsquo; belief in the flying witches and their legend of
shipwreck. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb237" href="#pb237" name=

<p class="first">In this chapter an account will be given of the ideas
and beliefs associated with shipwreck, and of the various precautions
which the natives take to insure their own safety. We shall find here a
strange mixture of definite, matter of fact information, and of
fantastic superstitions. Taking a critical, ethnographic side view, it
may be said directly that the fanciful elements are intertwined with
the realities in such a manner, that it is difficult to make a
distinction between what is mere mytho-poetic fiction and what is a
customary rule of behaviour, drawn from actual experience. The best way
of presenting this material will be to give a consecutive account of a
shipwreck, as it is told in Kiriwinian villages by the travelled old
men to the younger generation. I shall adduce in it the several magical
formul&aelig;, the rules of behaviour, the part played by the
miraculous fish, and the complex ritual of the saved party as they flee
from the pursuing <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>.</p>
<p>These&mdash;the flying witches&mdash;will play such an important
part in the account, that I must begin with a detailed description of
the various beliefs referring to them, though the subject has been
touched upon once or twice before (<a href="#div2.7">Chapter II,
Division VII</a>, and other places). The sea and sailing upon it are
intimately associated in the mind of a Boyowan with these women. They
had to be mentioned in the description of canoe magic, and we shall see
what an important part they play in the legends of canoe building. In
his sailing, whether he goes to Kitava or further East, or whether he
travels South to the Amphletts and Dobu, they form one of the main
preoccupations of a Boyowan sailor. For they are not only dangerous to
him, but to a certain extent, foreign. Boyowa, with the exception of
Wawela and one or two other villages on the Eastern coast, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name="pb238">238</a>]</span>and
in the South of the island, is an ethnographic district, where the
flying witches do not exist, although they visit it from time to time.
Whereas all the surrounding tribes are full of women who practice this
form of sorcery. Thus sailing South, the Boyowan is travelling straight
into the heart of their domain.</p>
<p>These women have the power of making themselves invisible, and
flying at night through the air. The orthodox belief is that a woman
who is a <i lang="kij">yoyova</i> can send forth a double which is
invisible at will, but may appear in the form of a flying fox or of a
night bird or a firefly. There is also a belief that a <i lang=
"kij">yoyova</i> develops within her a something, shaped like an egg,
or like a young, unripe coco-nut. This something is called as a matter
of fact <i lang="kij">kapuwana</i>, which is the word for a small
coco-nut.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8114src" href="#xd26e8114" name=
"xd26e8114src">1</a> This idea remains in the native&rsquo;s mind in a
vague, indefinite, undifferentiated form, and any attempt to elicit a
more detailed definition by asking him such questions, as to whether
the <i lang="kij">kapuwana</i> is a material object or not, would be to
smuggle our own categories into his belief, where they do not exist.
The <i lang="kij">kapuwana</i> is anyhow believed to be the something
which in the nightly flights leaves the body of the <i lang=
"kij">yoyova</i> and assumes the various forms in which the <i lang=
"kij">mulukwausi</i> appears. Another variant of the belief about the
<i lang="kij">yoyova</i> is, that those who know their magic especially
well, can fly themselves, bodily transporting themselves through the
air.</p>
<p>But it can never be sufficiently emphasised that all these beliefs
cannot be treated as consistent pieces of knowledge; they flow into one
another, and even the same native probably holds several views
rationally inconsistent with one another. Even their terminology
(compare the last Division of the foregoing chapter), cannot be taken
as implying a strict distinction or definition. Thus, the word <i lang=
"kij">yoyova</i> is applied to the woman as we meet her in the village,
and the word <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> will be used when we see
something suspicious flying through the air. But it would be incorrect
to systematise this use into a sort of doctrine and to say: &ldquo;An
individual woman is conceived as consisting of an actual living
personality called <i lang="kij">yoyova</i>, and of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href="#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span>an
immaterial, spiritual principle called <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>,
which in its potential form is the <i lang="kij">kapuwana</i>.&rdquo;
In doing this we would do much what the Medi&aelig;val Scholastics did
to the living faith of the early ages. The native feels and fears his
belief rather than formulates it clearly to himself. He uses terms and
expressions, and thus, as used by him, we must collect them as
documents of belief, but abstain from working them out into a
consistent theory; for this represents neither the native&rsquo;s mind
nor any other form of reality.</p>
<p>As we remember from <a href="#ch2">Chapter II</a>, the flying
witches are a nefarious agency, second in importance to the <i lang=
"kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i> (male sorcerer), but in efficiency far more
deadly even than he himself. In contrast to the <i lang=
"kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i>, who is simply a man in possession of a special
form of magic, the <i lang="kij">yoyova</i> have to be gradually
initiated into their status. Only a small child, whose mother is a
witch, can become a witch herself. When a witch gives birth to a female
child, she medicates a piece of obsidian, and cuts off the navel
string. The navel string is then buried, with the recital of a magical
formula, in the house, and not, as is done in all ordinary cases, in
the garden. Soon after, the witch will carry her daughter to the sea
beach, utter a spell over some brine in a coco-nut cup, and give the
child to drink. After that, the child is submerged in water and washed,
a kind of witch&rsquo;s baptism! Then she brings back the baby into the
house, utters a spell over a mat, and folds her up in it. At night, she
carries the baby through the air, and goes to a trysting place of other
<i lang="kij">yoyova</i>, where she presents her child ritually to
them. In contrast to the usual custom of young mothers of sleeping over
a small fire, a sorceress lies with her baby in the cold. As the child
grows up, the mother will take it into her arms and carry it through
the air on her nightly rounds. Entering girlhood at the age when the
first grass skirt is put on a maiden, the little prospective witch will
begin to fly herself.</p>
<p>Another system of training, running side by side with flying,
consists in accustoming the child to participation in human flesh. Even
before the growing witch will begin to fly on her own account, the
mother will take her to the ghoulish repasts, where she and other
witches sit over a corpse, eating its eyes, tongue, lungs, and
entrails. There the little girl receives her first share of corpse
flesh, and trains her taste to like this diet. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb240" href="#pb240" name="pb240">240</a>]</span></p>
<p>There are other forms of training ascribed to mothers solicitous
that their daughters should grow up into efficient <i lang=
"kij">yoyova</i> and <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>. At night the mother
will stand on one side of the hut, with the child in her hands, and
throw the little one over the roof. Then quickly, with the speed only
possible to a <i lang="kij">yoyova</i>, she will move round, and catch
the child on the other side. This happens before the child begins to
fly, and is meant to accustom it to passing rapidly through the air. Or
again, the child will be held by her feet, head down, and remain in
this position while the mother utters a spell. Thus gradually, by all
these means, the child acquires the powers and tastes of a <i lang=
"kij">yoyova</i>.</p>
<p>It is easy to pick out such girls from other children. They will be
recognisable by their crude tastes, and more especially by their habit
of eating raw flesh of pigs or uncooked fish. And here we come to a
point, where mythical superstition plays over into something more real,
for I have been assured by reliable informants, and those not only
natives, that there are cases of girls who will show a craving for raw
meat, and when a pig is being quartered in the village will drink its
blood and tear up its flesh. These statements I never could verify by
direct observations, and they may be only the result of very strong
belief projecting its own realities, as we see on every side in our own
society in miraculous cures, spiritistic phenomena, etc., etc. If,
however, the eating of raw flesh by girl children really occurs, this
simply means that they play up to what they know is said and believed
about them. This again is a phenomenon of social <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e8204" title="Source: pyschology">psychology</span> met with in
many phases of Trobriand society and in our own.</p>
<p>This does not mean that the character of a <i lang="kij">yoyova</i>
is publicly donned. Indeed, though a man often owns up to the fact that
he is a <i lang="kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i>, and treats his speciality
quite openly in conversation, a woman will never directly confess to
being a <i lang="kij">yoyova</i>, not even to her own husband. But she
will certainly be marked by everyone as such a one, and she will often
play up to the r&ocirc;le, for it is always an advantage to be supposed
to be endowed with supernatural powers. And moreover, being a sorceress
is also a good source of income. A woman will often receive presents
with the understanding that such and such a person has to be injured.
She will openly take gifts, avowedly in payment for healing someone who
has been hurt by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb241" href="#pb241"
name="pb241">241</a>]</span>another witch. Thus the character of a
<i lang="kij">yoyova</i> is, in a way, a public one, and the most
important and powerful witches will be enumerated by name. But no woman
will ever openly speak about being one. Of course to have such a
character would in no way spoil matrimonial chances, or do anything but
enhance the social status of a woman.</p>
<p>So deep is the belief in the efficacy of magic, and in magic being
the only means of acquiring extraordinary faculties, that all powers of
a <i lang="kij">yoyova</i> are attributed to magic. As we saw in the
training of a young <i lang="kij">yoyova</i>, magic has to be spoken at
every stage in order to impart to her the character of a witch. A full
blown <i lang="kij">yoyova</i> has to utter special magic each time she
wishes to be invisible, or when she wants to fly, or acquire higher
speed, or penetrate darkness and distance in order to find out whether
an accident is happening there. But like everything referring to this
form of witchcraft, these formul&aelig; never come to light. Although I
was able to acquire a whole body of spells of the <i lang=
"kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i> sorcery, I could not even lift the fringe of
the impenetrable veil, surrounding the magic of the <i lang=
"kij">yoyova</i>. As a matter of fact, there is not the slightest doubt
for me that not one single rite, not one single word of this magic,
have ever existed.</p>
<p>Once a <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> is fully trained in her craft,
she will often go at night to feed on corpses or to destroy shipwrecked
mariners, for these are her two main pursuits. By a special sense,
acquired through magic, she can &lsquo;hear,&rsquo; as the natives say,
that a man has died at such and such a place, or that a canoe is in
danger. Even a young apprenticed <i lang="kij">yoyova</i> will have her
hearing so sharpened that she will tell her mother: &ldquo;Mother, I
hear, they cry!&rdquo; Which means that a man is dead or dying at some
place. Or she will say: &ldquo;Mother, a <i lang="kij">waga</i> is
sinking!&rdquo; And then they both will fly to the spot.</p>
<p>When she goes out on such an errand, the <i lang="kij">yoyova</i>
leaves her body behind. Then she climbs a tree, and reciting some
magic, she ties a creeper to it. Then, she flies off, along this
creeper, which snaps behind her. This is the moment when we see the
fire flying through the sky. Whenever the natives see a falling star,
they know it is a <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> on her flight. Another
version is that, when a <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> recites a certain
spell, a tree which stands somewhere near her destination bends down
towards the other tree on which she is perched. She jumps from one top
to the other, and it is then that we see the fire. According
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb242" href="#pb242" name=
"pb242">242</a>]</span>to some versions, the <i lang=
"kij">mulukwausi</i>, that is, the witch in her flying state, moves
about naked, leaving her skirt round the body, which remains asleep in
the hut. Other versions depict her as tying her skirt tightly round her
when flying, and beating her buttocks with a magical pandanus streamer.
These latter versions are embodied in the magic quoted above in
<a href="#ch5">Chapter V</a>.</p>
<p>Arrived at the place where lies the corpse, the <i lang=
"kij">mulukwausi</i>, with others who have also flown to the spot,
perches on some high object, the top of a tree or the gable of a hut.
There they all wait till they can feast on the corpse, and such is
their greed and appetite that they are also very dangerous to living
men. People who collect round the dead body to mourn and wake over it
often have a special spell against the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>
recited over them, by the one who knows it. They are careful not to
stray away from the others, and, during burial of the dead and
afterwards, they believe the air to be infested with these dangerous
witches, who spread the smell of carrion around them.</p>
<p>The <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> will eat out the eyes, the tongue,
and the &lsquo;insides&rsquo; (<i lang="kij">lopoula</i>) of the
corpse; when they attack a living man they may simply hit him or kick
him, and then he becomes more or less sick. But sometimes they get hold
of an individual and treat him like a corpse and eat some of his
organs, and then the man dies. It is possible to diagnose this, for
such a person would quickly fail, losing his speech, his vision,
sometimes suddenly being bereft of all power of movement. It is a less
dangerous method to the living man when the <i lang=
"kij">mulukwausi</i> instead of eating his &lsquo;insides&rsquo; on the
spot, simply remove them. They hide them in a place only known to
themselves, in order to have provision for a future feast. In that case
there is some hope for the victim. Another <i lang="kij">yoyova</i>,
summoned quickly by the relations of the dying and well paid by them,
will, in the form of a <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, go forth, search
for the missing organs, and, if she is fortunate enough to find and
restore them, save the life of the victim.</p>
<p>Kenoriya, the favourite daughter of To&rsquo;ulawa, the chief of
Omarakana, while on a visit to another village, was deprived of her
internal organs by the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>. When brought home,
she could neither move nor speak, and lay down as if dead. Her mother
and other relatives already began their mortuary wailing over her, the
chief himself broke out into loud lamentations. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb243" href="#pb243" name="pb243">243</a>]</span>But
nevertheless, as a forlorn hope, they sent for a woman from Wawela, a
well-known <i lang="kij">yoyova</i>, who after receiving valuables and
food, flew out as a <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, and the very next
night found Kenoriya&rsquo;s insides somewhere in the <i lang=
"kij">raybwag</i>, near the beach of Kaulukuba, and restored her to
health.</p>
<p>Another authentic story is that of the daughter of a Greek trader
and a Kiriwinian woman from Oburaku. This story was told me by the lady
herself, in perfectly correct English, learnt in one of the white
settlements of New Guinea, where she had been brought up in the house
of a leading missionary. But the story was not spoilt by any
scepticism; it was told with perfect simplicity and conviction.</p>
<p>When she was a little girl, a woman called Sewawela, from the Island
of Kitava, but married to a man of Wawela, came to her parents&rsquo;
house and wanted to sell a mat. They did not buy it, and gave her only
a little food, which, as she was a renowned <i lang="kij">yoyova</i>
and accustomed therefore to deferential treatment, made her angry. When
night came, the little one was playing on the beach in front of the
house, when the parents saw a big firefly hovering about the child. The
insect then flew round the parents and went into the room. Seeing that
there was something strange about the firefly, they called the girl and
put her to bed at once. But she fell ill immediately, could not sleep
all night, and the parents, with many native attendants, had to keep
watch over her. Next morning, added the Kiriwinian mother, who was
listening to her daughter telling me the tale, the girl &ldquo;<i lang=
"kij">boge ikarige; kukula wala ipipisi</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;she was dead
already, but her heart was still beating.&rdquo; All the women present
broke out into the ceremonial lamentations. The father of the
girl&rsquo;s mother, however, went to Wawela, and got hold of another
<i lang="kij">yoyova</i>, called Bomrimwari. She took some herbs and
smeared her own body all over. Then she went out in the form of a
<i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> in search of the girl&rsquo;s <i lang=
"kij">lopoulo</i> (inside). She searched about and found it in the hut
of Sewawela, where it lay on the shelf on which are kept the big
clay-pots, in which the <i lang="kij">mona</i> (taro pudding), is
cooked ceremonially. There it lay &ldquo;red as calico.&rdquo; Sewawela
had left it there, while she went into the garden with her husband,
meaning to eat it on her return. Had this happened, the girl could not
have been saved. As soon as Bomrimwari found it, she made some magic
over it then and there. Then she came <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb244" href="#pb244" name="pb244">244</a>]</span>back to the
trader&rsquo;s compound, made some more magic over ginger-root, and
water, and caused the <i lang="kij">lopoulo</i> to return to its place.
After that, the little girl soon got better. A substantial payment was
given by the parents to the <i lang="kij">yoyova</i> for saving their
child.</p>
<p>Living in Oburaku, a village on the Southern half of Boyowa, I was
on the boundary between the district where the <i lang="kij">yoyova</i>
do not exist, and the other one, to the East, where they are plentiful.
On the other side of the Island, which is very narrow at this part, is
the village of Wawela, where almost every woman is reputed to be a
witch, and some are quite notorious. Going over the <i lang=
"kij">raybwag</i> at night, the natives of Oburaku would point out
certain fireflies which would suddenly disappear, not to relight again.
These were the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>. Again, at night, swarms of
flying foxes used to flap over the tall trees, making for the big,
swampy Island of Boymapo&rsquo;u which closes in the Lagoon opposite
the village. These too were <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, travelling
from the East, their real home. They also used to perch on the tops of
the trees growing on the water&rsquo;s edge, and this was therefore an
especially dangerous spot after sunset. I was often warned not to sit
there on the platforms of the beached canoes, as I liked to do,
watching the play of colours on the smooth, muddy waters, and on the
bright mangroves. When I fell ill soon after, everybody decided that I
had been &lsquo;kicked&rsquo; by the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, and
some magic was performed over me by my friend Molilakwa, the same who
gave me some formul&aelig; of <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>, the
magic spoken at sea against witches. In this case his efforts were
entirely successful, and my quick recovery was attributed by the
natives solely to the spells.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What interests us most about <i lang=
"kij">mulukwausi</i>, is their association with the sea and shipwreck.
Very often they will roam over the sea, and meet at a trysting place on
a reef. There they will partake of a special kind of coral, broken off
from a reef, a kind called by the natives <i lang="kij">nada</i>. This
whets their appetite for human flesh, exactly as the drinking of salt
water does with the <i lang="kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i>. They have also
some indirect power over the elements in the sea. Although the natives
do not quite agree on the point, there is no doubt that a definite
connection <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb245" href="#pb245" name=
"pb245">245</a>]</span>exists between the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>
and all the other dangers which may be met in the sea, such as sharks,
the &lsquo;gaping depth&rsquo; (<i lang="kij">ikapwagega wiwitu</i>),
many of the small sea animals, crabs, some of the shells and the other
things to be mentioned presently, all of which are considered to be the
cause of death of drowning men. Thus the belief is quite definite that,
in being cast into the water by the shipwreck, men do not meet any real
danger except by being eaten by the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, the
sharks, and the other animals. If by the proper magic these influences
can be obviated, the drowning men will escape unscathed. The belief in
the omnipotence of man, or rather, woman in this case, and of the equal
power in antidoting by magic, governs all the ideas of these natives
about shipwreck. The supreme remedy and insurance against any dangers
lies in the magic of mist, called <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>,
which, side by side with Kula magic, and the magic of the canoes, is
the third of the indispensable magical equipments of a sailor.</p>
<p>A man who knows well the <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> is
considered to be able to travel safely through the most dangerous seas.
A renowned chief, Maniyuwa, who was reputed as one of the greatest
masters in <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> as well as in other magic,
died in Dobu on an expedition about two generations ago. His son,
Maradiana, had learnt his father&rsquo;s <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>. Although the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> are
extremely dangerous in the presence of a corpse, and though the natives
would never dream of putting a dead body on a canoe, and thus
multiplying the probabilities of an attack by the witches, still,
Maradiana, trusting to his <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>, brought the
corpse back to Boyowa without mishap. This act, a testimony to the
daring sailor&rsquo;s great prowess, and to the efficiency of the
<i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> magic, is kept alive in the memory and
tradition of the natives. One of my informants, boasting of his
<i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>, told me how once, on a return from
Dobu, he performed his rites. Such a mist arose as a consequence of it
that the rest of the canoes lost their way, and arrived in the island
of Kayleula. Indeed, if we can speak of a belief being alive, that is,
of having a strong hold over human imagination, the belief in the
danger from <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> at sea is emphatically such a
one. In times of mental stress, in times of the slightest danger at
sea, or when a dying or dead person is near, the natives at once
respond emotionally in terms of this belief. No one could live among
these natives, speaking their language, and following their
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb246" href="#pb246" name=
"pb246">246</a>]</span>tribal life, without constantly coming up
against the belief in <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, and in the
efficiency of the <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>.</p>
<p>As in all other magic, also here, there are various systems of
<i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>, that is, there are various
formul&aelig;, slightly differing in their expressions, though usually
similar in their fundamental wordings and in certain &lsquo;key&rsquo;
expressions. In each system, there are two main types of spells, the
<i lang="kij">giyotanawa</i>, or the <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> of
the Underneath, and the <i lang="kij">giyorokaywa</i>, or the <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> of the Above. The first one usually consists of
a short formula or formul&aelig; spoken over some stones and some lime
in a lime pot and over some ginger root. This <i lang=
"kij">giyotanawa</i>, as its name indicates, is magic directed against
the evil agencies, awaiting the drowning men from below. Its spells
close up &lsquo;the gaping depth&rsquo; and they screen off the
shipwrecked men from the eyes of the sharks. They also protect them
from the other evil things, which cause the death of a man in drowning.
The several little sea worms found on the beach, the crabs, the
poisonous fish, <i lang="kij">soka</i>, and the spiky fish, <i lang=
"kij">baiba&rsquo;i</i>, as well as the jumping stones, whether
<i lang="kij">vineylida</i> or <i lang="kij">nu&rsquo;akekepaki</i>,
are all warded off and blinded by the <i lang="kij">giyotanawa</i>.
Perhaps the most extraordinary belief in this connection is that the
<i lang="kij">tokwalu</i>, the carved human figures on the prow boards,
the <i lang="kij">guwaya</i>, the semi-human effigy on the mast top, as
well as the canoe ribs would &lsquo;eat&rsquo; the drowning men if not
magically &lsquo;treated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> of the &lsquo;Above,&rsquo; the
<i lang="kij">giyorokaywa</i>, consists of long spells, recited over
some ginger root, on several occasions before sailing, and during bad
weather or shipwreck. They are directed exclusively against the
<i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, and form therefore the more important
class of the two. These spells must never be recited at night, as then
the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> could see and hear the man, and make
his magic inefficient. Again, the spell of the Above, when recited at
sea, must be spoken so that the magician is not covered with spray, for
if his mouth were wet with sea water, the smell would attract rather
than disperse, the flying witches. The man who knows the <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> must also be very careful at meal times.
Children may not speak, play about, or make any noise while he eats,
nor should anyone go round him behind his back while he is thus
engaged; normay they point out anything with the finger. Should the man
be thus disturbed during his food, he would have to stop eating at
once, and not resume it till the next meal time. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb247" href="#pb247" name="pb247">247</a>]</span></p>
<p>Now the leading idea of <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> is that it
produces some sort of mist. The <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> who follow
the canoe, the sharks and live stones which lie in wait for it, the
depth with all its horror, and the <i lang="fr">d&eacute;bris</i> of
the canoe ready to harm the owner, all these are blinded by the mist
that arises in obedience to these spells. Thus the paralysing effect of
these two main forms of magic and the specialised sphere of influence
of each of them, are definite and clear dogmas of native belief.</p>
<p>But here again we must not try to press the interpretation of these
dogmas too far. Some sort of mist covers the eyes of all the evil
agencies or blinds them; it makes the natives invisible from them. But
to ask whether the <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> produces a real
mist, visible also to man, or only a supernatural one, visible only to
the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>; or whether it simply blinds their
eyes so that they see nothing, would be asking too much. The same
native who will boast of having produced a real mist, so great that it
led astray his companions, will next day perform the <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> in the village during a burial, and affirm that
the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> are in a mist, though obviously a
perfectly clear atmosphere surrounds the whole proceedings. The natives
will tell how, sailing on a windy but clear day, after a <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> has been recited into the eye of the wind, they
hear the shrieks of the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, who, losing their
companions and the scent of the trail, hail one another in the dark.
Again, some expressions seem to represent the view that it is mainly an
action on the eyes of the witches. &lsquo;<i lang="kij">Idudubila
matala mulukwausi</i>,&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It darkens the eyes of the
mulukwausi,&rsquo; or &lsquo;<i lang=
"kij">iguyugwayu</i>&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;It blinds,&rsquo; the natives
will say. And when asked:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;What do the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> see,
then?&rdquo; they will answer: &ldquo;They will see mist only. They do
not see the places, they do not see the men, only mist.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus here, as in all cases of belief, there is a certain latitude,
within which the opinions and views may vary, and only the broad
outline, which surrounds them, is definitely fixed by tradition,
embodied in ritual, and expressed by the phraseology of magical
formul&aelig; or by the statements of a myth.</p>
<p>I have thus defined the manner in which the natives face the dangers
of the sea; we have found, that the fundamental conceptions underlying
this attitude are, that in shipwreck, men are entirely in the hands of
the witches, and that from <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href=
"#pb248" name="pb248">248</a>]</span>this, only their own magical
defence can save them. This defence consists in the rites and
formul&aelig; of the <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>, of which we have
also learnt the leading principles. Now, a consecutive description must
be given of how this magic is performed when a <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> sets out on an expedition. And following up this
expedition, it must be told how the natives imagine a shipwreck, and
what they believe the behaviour of the shipwrecked party would be.</p>

<p class="first">I shall give this narrative in a consecutive manner,
as it was told to me by some of the most experienced and renowned
Trobriand sailors in Sinaketa, Oburaku, and Omarakana. We can imagine
that exactly such a narrative would be told by a veteran <i lang=

Yakum, as our Kula party sit round the camp fires at night. One of the
old men, well-known for the excellence of his <i lang=

entering minutely into all the details, however often the others might
have heard about them before, or even assisted at the performance of
his magic. He would then proceed to describe, with extreme realism, and
dwelling graphically on every point, the story of a shipwreck, very
much as if he had gone through one himself. As a matter of fact, no one
alive at present has had any personal experience of such a catastrophe,
though many have lived through frequent narrow escapes in stormy
weather. Based on this, and on what they have heard themselves of the
tradition of shipwrecks, natives will tell the story with
characteristic vividness. Thus, the account given below is not only a
summary of native belief, it is an ethnographic document in itself,
representing the manner in which such type of narrative would be told
over camp fires, the same subject being over and over again repeated by
the same man, and listened to by the same audience, exactly as we, when
children, or the peasants of Eastern Europe, will hearken to familiar
fairy tales and M&auml;rchen. The only deviation here from what would
actually take place in such a story-telling, is the insertion of
magical formul&aelig; into the narrative. The speaker might indeed
repeat his magic, were he speaking in broad daylight, in his village,
to a group of close kinsmen and friends. But being on a small island in
the middle of the ocean, and at night, the recital of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb249" href="#pb249" name=
"pb249">249</a>]</span>spells would be a taboo of the <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>; nor would a man ever recite his magic before a
numerous audience, except on certain occasions at mortuary vigils,
where people are expected to chant their magic aloud before hundreds of
listeners.</p>
<p>Returning then again to our group of sailors, who sit under the
stunted pandanus trees of Yakum, let us listen to one of the companions
of the daring Maradiana, now dead, to one of the descendants of the
great Maniyuwa. He will tell us how, early in the morning, on the day
of departure from Sinaketa, or sometimes on the next morning, when they
leave Muwa, he performs the first rite of <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>. Wrapping up a piece of <i lang="kij">leyya</i>
(wild ginger root) in a bit of dried banana leaf, he chants over it the
long spell of the <i lang="kij">giyorokaywa</i>, the <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> of the Above. He chants this spell into the
leaf, holding it cup-shaped, with the morsel of ginger root at the
bottom, so that the spell might enter into the substance to be
medicated. After that, the leaf is immediately wrapped round, so as to
imprison the magical virtue, and the magician ties the parcel round his
left arm, with a piece of bast or string. Sometimes he will medicate
two bits of ginger and make two parcels, of which the other will be
placed in a string necklet, and carried on his breast. Our narrator,
who is the master of one of the canoes, will probably not be the only
one within the circle round the camp fire, who carries these bundles of
medicated ginger; for though a <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> must always
perform this rite as well as know all the other magic of shipwreck, as
a rule several of the older members of his crew also know it, and have
also prepared their magical bundles.</p>
<p>This is one of the spells of the <i lang="kij">giyorokaywa</i>, such
as the old man said over the ginger root:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;I will befog Muyuwa!&rdquo; (repeated).
&ldquo;I will befog Misima!&rdquo; (repeated). &ldquo;The mist springs
up; the mist makes them tremble. I befog the front, I shut off the
rear; I befog the rear, I shut off the front. I fill with mist, mist
springs up; I fill with mist, the mist which makes them
tremble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is the opening part of the formula, very clear, and easy to be
translated. The mist is magically invoked, the word for mist being
repeated with several verbal combinations, in a rhythmic and
alliterative manner. The <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb250" href=
"#pb250" name="pb250">250</a>]</span>expression tremble, <i lang=
"kij">maysisi</i>, refers to a peculiar belief, that when a sorcerer or
sorceress approaches the victim, and this man paralyses them with a
counter spell, they lose their bearings, and stand there trembling.</p>
<p>The main part of this spell opens up with the word &lsquo;<i lang=
"kij">aga&rsquo;u</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;I befog,&rsquo; which, like all
such leading words of a spell is first of all intoned in a long,
drawn-out chant, and then quickly repeated with a series of words. Then
the word &lsquo;<i lang="kij">aga&rsquo;u</i>&rsquo; is replaced by
&lsquo;<i lang="kij">aga&rsquo;u sulu</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;I befog, lead
astray,&rsquo; which in its turn makes way for, &lsquo;<i lang=
"kij">aga&rsquo;u boda</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;I befog, shut off.&rsquo; The
list of words repeated in succession with each of these three
expressions is a long one. It is headed by the words &lsquo;the eyes of
the witches.&rsquo; Then, &lsquo;the eyes of the sea-crab.&rsquo; Then,
always with the word &lsquo;eyes,&rsquo; the animals, worms and insects
which threaten drowning men in the sea, are enumerated. After they are
exhausted, the various parts of the body are repeated; then finally, a
long list of villages is recited, preceded by the word <i lang=
"kij">aga&rsquo;u</i>, forming phrases such as: &ldquo;I befog the eyes
of the women of Wawela, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us reconstruct a piece of this middle part in a consecutive
manner. &ldquo;I befog &hellip;! I befog, I befog, the eyes of the
witches! I befog the eyes of the little crabs! I befog the eyes of the
hermit crab! I befog the eyes of the insects on the beach! &hellip;
etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I befog the hand, I befog the foot, I befog the head. I befog
the shoulders &hellip; etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I befog the eyes of the women of Wawela; I befog the eyes of
the women of Kaulasi; I befog the eyes of the women of Kumilabwaga, I
befog the eyes of the women of Vakuta &hellip; etc., etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I befog, lead astray, the eyes of the witches; I befog, lead
astray the eyes of the little crab! &hellip; etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I befog, shut off the eyes of the witches, I befog, shut off
the eyes of the little crab &hellip; etc., etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It can easily be seen how long drawn such a spell is, especially as
in this middle part, the magician will often come back to where he has
started, and repeat the leading word over and over again with the
others. Indeed, this can be taken as a typical <i lang=
"kij">tapwana</i>, or middle part, of a long spell, where the leading
words are, so to speak, well rubbed into the various other expressions.
One feature of this middle part is remarkable, namely, that the beings
from below, the crabs, the sea insects and worms are invoked, although
the spell is one of the <i lang="kij">giyorokaywa</i> type, the magic
of the Above. This is an inconsistency <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb251" href="#pb251" name="pb251">251</a>]</span>frequently met with;
a contradiction between the ideas embodied in the spell, and the theory
of the magic, as explicitly formulated by the informants. The parts of
the body enumerated in the <i lang="kij">tapwana</i> refer to the
magician&rsquo;s own person, and to his companions in the canoe. By
this part of the spell, he surrounds himself and all his companions
with mist, which makes them invisible to all the evil influences.</p>
<p>After the long <i lang="kij">tapwana</i> has been recited, there
follows the last part, which, however, is not chanted in this case, but
spoken in a low, persuasive, tender voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hit thy flanks; I fold over thy mat, thy bleached mat of
pandanus; I shall make it into thy mantle. I take thy sleeping <i lang=
"kij">doba</i> (grass skirt), I cover thy loins; remain there, snore
within thy house! I alone myself&rdquo; (here the reciter&rsquo;s name
is uttered) &ldquo;I shall remain in the sea, I shall swim!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This last part throws some interesting sidelights on native belief
in <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>. We see here the expression of the idea
that the body of the witch remains in the house, whilst she herself
goes out on her nefarious errand. Molilakwa, the magician of Oburaku
who gave me this spell, said in commentary to this last part:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The <i lang="kij">yoyova</i> casts off her body
(<i lang="kij">inini wowola</i>&mdash;which really means &lsquo;peals
off her skin&rsquo;); she lies down and sleeps, we hear her snoring.
Her covering (<i lang="kij">kapwalela</i> that is, her outward body,
her skin) remains in the house, and she herself flies (<i lang=
"kij">titolela biyova</i>). Her skirt remains in the house, she flies
naked. When she meets men, she eats us. In the morning, she puts on her
body, and lies down in her hut. When we cover her loins with the
<i lang="kij">doba</i>, she cannot fly any more.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This last sentence refers to the magical act of covering, as
expressed in the last part of the spell.</p>
<p>Here we find another variant of belief as to the nature of the
<i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, to be added to those mentioned before.
Previously we met the belief of the disassociation of the woman into
the part that remains, and the part that flies. But here the real
personality is located in the flying part, whereas what remains is the
&lsquo;covering.&rsquo; To imagine the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>,
the flying part, as a &lsquo;sending,&rsquo; in the light of this
belief, would not be correct. In general, such categories as
&lsquo;agent,&rsquo; and &lsquo;sending,&rsquo; or as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb252" href="#pb252" name=
"pb252">252</a>]</span>&lsquo;real self&rsquo; and
&lsquo;emanation&rsquo; etc., etc., can be applied to native belief as
rough approximations only, and the exact definition should be given in
terms of native statement.</p>
<p>The final sentence of this spell, containing the wish to remain
alone in the sea, to be allowed to swim and drift, is a testimony to
the belief that without <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, there is no
danger to a man adrift on a piece of wreckage among the foaming waves
of a stormy sea.</p>
<p>After reciting this lengthy spell, the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>,
as he tells us in his narrative, has had to perform another rite, this
time, over his lime-pot. Taking out the stopper of rolled palm leaf and
plaited fibre from the baked and decorated gourd in which he keeps his
lime, he utters another spell of the <i lang="kij">giyorokaywa</i>
cycle:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Giyorokaywa No. 2 (Pwaka Kayga&rsquo;u).</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;There on Muruwa, I arise, I stand up! Iwa,
Sewatupa, at the head&mdash;I rumble, I disperse. Kasabwaybwayreta,
Namedili, Toburitolu, Tobwebweso, Tauva&rsquo;u, Bo&rsquo;abwa&rsquo;u,
Rasarasa. They are lost, they disappear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This beginning, full of archaic expressions, implicit meanings and
allusions and personal names, is very obscure. The first words refer
probably to the head-quarters of sorcery; Muruwa (or
Murua&mdash;Woodlark Island), Iwa, Sewatupa. The long list of personal
names following afterwards contains some mythical ones, like
Kasabwaybwayreta, and some others, which I cannot explain, though the
words Tobwebweso, Tauva&rsquo;u, and Bo&rsquo;abwa&rsquo;u suggest that
this is a list in which some sorcerers&rsquo; names figure. As a rule,
in such spells, a list of names signifies that all those who have used
and handed down this formula, are enumerated. In some cases the people
mentioned are frankly mythical heroes. Sometimes a few mythical names
are chanted, and then comes a string of actual people, forming a sort
of pedigree of the spell. If these in this spell are ancestor names
they all refer to mythical personalities, and not to real
ancestors.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e8721src" href="#xd26e8721" name=
"xd26e8721src">2</a> The last words contained an expression typical of
the <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>. Then comes the middle part.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb253" href="#pb253" name=

<p>&ldquo;I arise, I escape from <i lang="kij">bara&rsquo;u</i>; I

<i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>. I arise, I escape from <i lang=
"kij">bowo&rsquo;u</i>, etc.,&rdquo; repeating the leading words
&ldquo;I arise, I escape from&mdash;&rdquo; with the words used to
describe the flying witches in the various surrounding districts. Thus
the word <i lang="kij">bara&rsquo;u</i> comes from Muyuwa (Woodlark
Island), where it describes the sorceress, and not, as in other Massim
districts, a male sorcerer. The words <i lang="kij">yoyova,
mulukwausi</i> need no explanation. <i lang="kij">Bowo&rsquo;u</i> is
an Amphlettan word. Words from Dobu, Tubetube, etc., follow. Then the
whole period is repeated, adding &lsquo;eyes of&rsquo; in the middle of
each phrase, so that it runs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arise, I escape from the eyes of the <i lang=
"kij">bara&rsquo;u</i>. I arise, I escape from the eyes of the <i lang=
"kij">yoyova</i>, etc.&rdquo; The leading words, &lsquo;I arise, I
escape from&rsquo; are then replaced by<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e8760" title="Not in source">:</span> &lsquo;They wander
astray,&rsquo; which, again, make way to &lsquo;the sea is cleared
off.&rsquo; This whole middle part of the spell is clear, and needs no
commentary. Then comes the concluding period (<i lang=
"kij">dogina</i>):</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a <i lang="kij">manuderi</i> (small bird), I am a
<i lang="kij">kidikidi</i> (small sea bird), I am a floating log, I am
a piece of sea-weed; I shall produce mist till it encloses all, I shall
befog, I shall shut off with fog. Mist, enveloped in mist, dissolving
in mist am I. Clear is the sea, (the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> are)
straying in mist.&rdquo; This part also needs no special
commentary.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This is again a long spell of the <i lang="kij">giyorokaywa</i>
type, that is, directed against the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, and
in this the spell is consistent, for the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>
alone are invoked in the middle period.</p>
<p>After the spell has been chanted into the lime pot, this is well
stoppered, and not opened till the end of the journey. It must be noted
that these two <i lang="kij">giyorokaywa</i> spells have been spoken by
our <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> in the village or on Muwa beach, and in
day time. For, as said above, it is a taboo to utter them in the night
or at sea. From the moment he has spoken these two spells, both
medicated substances, the ginger root and the lime in the lime pot,
remain near him. He has also in the canoe some stones of those brought
from the Koya, and called <i lang="kij">binabina</i>, in distinction to
the dead coral, which is called <i lang="kij">dakuna</i>. Over these
stones, at the moment of the occurrence of danger, a spell of the
Underneath, a <i lang="kij">giyotanawa</i> will be recited. The
following is a formula of this type, short as they always are.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb254" href="#pb254" name=

Sharks of Kaduwaga, I press, I close down,&rdquo; etc., the sharks of
Muwa, Galeya, Bonari, and Kaulokoki being invoked in turn. All these
words are names of marked parts of the sea, in and around the Trobriand
Lagoon. The formula ends up with the following peroration: &ldquo;I
press down thy neck, I open up thy passage of Kiyawa, I kick thee down,
O shark. Duck down under water, shark. Die, shark, die away.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The commentary to the opening sentences given by my informant,
Molilakwa of Oburaku, was:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;This magic is taught to people when they are
quite young. Hence the mention of young people.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The obliterating of traces will be made clearer by the account which
follows, in which we shall see that to obliterate traces, to put off
the scent the shark and <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> are the main
concerns of the shipwrecked party. The middle part refers to sharks
only, and so does the peroration. The passage of Kiyawa near Tuma is
mentioned in several types of magical exorcisms, when the evil
influence is being banished. This passage lies between the main island
and the island of Tuma, and leads into the unknown regions of the
North-Western seas.</p>
<p>It will be best to quote here another formula of the <i lang=
"kij">giyotanawa</i> type, and a very dramatic one. For this is the
formula spoken at the critical moment of shipwreck. At the moment when
the sailors decide to abandon the craft and to plunge into the sea, the
<i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> stands up in the canoe, and slowly turning
round so as to throw his words towards all four winds, intones in a
loud voice this spell:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Mist, etc. &hellip; surround me, my rigging,</p>
<p>Mist, etc. &hellip; surround me, my platform,&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so on, enumerating one after the other all the parts of the
canoe and its accessories. Then comes the final part of the spell:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shut off the skies with mist; I make the sea tremble with
mist; I close up your mouth, sharks, <i lang="kij">bonubonu</i> (small
worms), <i lang="kij">ginukwadewo</i> (other worms). Go underneath and
we shall swim on top.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Little is needed as a commentary to this magic. Its beginning is
very clear, and singularly well depicts the situation in which it is
uttered. The end refers directly to the primary aim of the magic, to
the warding off of the Underneath, of the dangerous animals in the sea.
The only ambiguity refers to the middle part, where the magical leading
words of &lsquo;enveloping by mist&rsquo; are associated with a list of
names of the parts of the canoe. I am not certain whether this is to be
interpreted, in the sense that the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> wants to
surround his whole canoe with mist so that it may not be seen by the
sharks, etc., or whether, on the contrary, just on the verge of
abandoning his canoe, and anxious to cut himself off from its various
parts which may turn on him and &lsquo;eat him,&rsquo; he therefore
wants to surround each of them with mist so that it may be blinded. The
latter interpretation fits the above-quoted belief that certain parts
of the canoe, especially the carved human figures on the <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e8879" title="Source: prowboard">prow-board</span> and
the mast, the ribs of the canoe, and certain other parts of its
construction, &lsquo;eat&rsquo; the shipwrecked men. But again, in this
spell, there are enumerated not certain parts, but every part, and that
undoubtedly is not consistent with this belief, so the question must
remain open.</p>

<i lang="kij">yavata</i> (North-Westerley Monsoon wind). They live in
the eye of the <i lang="kij">yavata</i>. The wind abates not, not a

All the <i lang="kij">usagelu</i> are afraid. The <i lang=

The <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> lose sight of us. We hear them shout

<i lang="kij">bonubonu</i>, the <i lang="kij">soka</i> do not see us;
the water is turbid. The canoe is swamped, the water is in it. It
drifts heavily, the waves break over us. We break the <i lang=

<i lang="kij">lamina</i> (outrigger float) is severed; we jump from the

and carries us. We drift, we drift, we drift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We approach a shore; the <i lang="kij">iraviyaka</i> brings
us there, the <i lang="kij">iraviyaka</i> puts us on the shallows. I

the stone on the beach; it makes a big thud; good; the <i lang=

a stone, we hear nothing: <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> are on the

it at the beach. I throw another stone. The <i lang=

drifted on the <i lang="kij">lamina</i>). I make a charm over the comb;
all the <i lang="kij">usagelu</i> comb their hair; they tease their
hair a long time. They are very cold; we do not make the fire. First, I

themselves at the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At day time, we don&rsquo;t go to the village; the <i lang=

<p>I have given here a reconstruction of a native account, as I have
often heard it told with characteristic vividness: spoken in short,
jerky sentences, with onamatopoetic representations of sound, the
narrative exaggerates certain features, and omits others. The
excellency of the narrator&rsquo;s own magic, the violence of the
elements at critical moments, he would always reiterate with monotonous
insistence. He would diverge into some correlated subject, jump ahead,
missing out several stages, come back, and so on, so that the whole is
quite incoherent and unintelligible to a white listener, though the
native audience follows its trend perfectly well. For it must be
remembered that, when a native tells such a story, the events are
already known to his listeners, who have grown up gradually becoming
familiar with the narrow range of their tribal folklore. Our <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i>, telling this story over again on the sandbank of
Yakum, would dwell on such points as allowed him to boast of his
<i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>, to describe the violence of the storm,
to bear witness to the traditional effects of the magic.</p>
<p>It is necessary for an Ethnographer to listen several times to such
a narrative, in order to have a fair chance of forming some coherent
idea of its trend. Afterwards, by means of direct examination, he can
succeed in placing the facts in their proper sequence. By questioning
the informants about details of rite and magic, it is possible then to
obtain interpretations and commentaries. Thus the whole of a narrative
can be constructed, the various fragments, with all their spontaneous
freshness, can be put in their proper places, and this is what I have
done in giving this account of shipwreck.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9093src" href="#xd26e9093" name="xd26e9093src">3</a></p>
<p>A few words of comment must now be given on the text of the above
narrative. In it, a number of magical rites were mentioned, besides
those which were described first with their spells. Something must be
said more in detail about the spells of the subsequent magical
performances. There are some eleven of them. First comes the ritual
invocation of the fish <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb259" href=
"#pb259" name="pb259">259</a>]</span>which helps the shipwrecked
sailors. The spell corresponding to this, is called <i lang=
"kij">kaytaria</i>, and it is an important formula, which every
<i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> is supposed to know. The question arises,
has this rite ever been practised in reality? Some of the actions taken
by the shipwrecked natives, such as the cutting of the the outrigger
float when the boat is abandoned, are quite rational. It would be
dangerous to float on the big, unwieldy canoe which might be constantly
turned round and round by the waves, and if smashed to pieces, might
injure the sailors with its wreckage. In this fact, perhaps there is
also the empirical basis for the belief that some fragments of the
canoe &lsquo;eat&rsquo; the shipwrecked men. The round, symmetrical log
of the <i lang="kij">lamina</i>, on the other hand, will serve as an
excellent lifebuoy. Perhaps a <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>, arrived at
such a pass, would really utter the <i lang="kij">kaytaria</i> spell.
And if the party were saved, they would probably all declare, and, no
doubt believe, that the fish had come to their summons, and somehow or
other helped in the rescue.</p>
<p>It is less easy to imagine what elements in such an experience might
have given rise to the myth that the natives, landed on the shore,
magically lift the fish from the shallow waters by means of a charmed
pole. This indeed seems a purely imaginary incident, and my main
informant, Molilakwa of Oburaku, from whom I obtained the <i lang=
"kij">kaytaria</i> spell, did not know the spell of the pole, and would
have had to leave the <i lang="kij">iraviaka</i> to its own fate in the
shallows. Nor could I hear of anyone else professing to know this
spell. The formula uttered over the stone to be thrown on the beach was
equally unknown to the circle of my informants. Of course, in all such
cases, when a man carrying on a system of magic would come to a gap in
his knowledge, he would perform the rite without the spell, or utter
the most suitable spell of the system. Thus here, as the stone is
thrown in order to reconnoitre whether the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>
are waiting for them, a spell of the <i lang="kij">giyorokaywa</i>, the
spell of the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, might be uttered over the
stone. Over the combs, as well as over the herbs on the beach, a
<i lang="kij">giyorokaywa</i> spell would be uttered, according to my
informants, but probably, a different spell from the one spoken
originally over the ginger root. Molilakwa, for instance, knows two
spells of the <i lang="kij">giyorokaywa</i>, both of which are suitable
to be spoken over the ginger and over the beach respectively. Then
there comes another <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb260" href="#pb260"
name="pb260">260</a>]</span>spell, to be uttered over the <i lang=
"kij">libu</i> plant, and in addressing the spider and the bush-hen.
Molilakwa told me that the same spell would be said in the three cases,
but neither he, nor anyone else, among my informants could give me this
spell. The magic done in the village, while the shipwrecked men
remained in the smoky hut, would be all accompanied by the <i lang=
"kij">leyya</i> (ginger) spells.</p>
<p>One incident in the above narrative might have struck the reader as
contradictory of the general theory of the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>
belief, that, namely, where the narrator declares that the party on the
beach have to wait till nightfall before they enter the village. The
general belief expressed in all the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>
legends, as well as in the taboos of the <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>, is that the witches are really dangerous only
at night, when they can see and hear better. Such contradictions, as I
have said, are often met in native belief, and in this, by the way, the
savages do not differ from ourselves. My informant, from whom I had
this version, simply said that such was the rule and the custom, and
that they had to wait till night. In another account, on the other
hand, I was told that the party must proceed to the village immediately
after having performed the several rites on the beach, whether night or
day.</p>
<p>There also arises the main question, regarding this narrative, to
which allusion has been made already, namely, how far does it represent
the normal behaviour in shipwreck, and how far is it a sort of
standardised myth? There is no doubt that shipwreck in these seas,
surrounded in many parts by islands, is not unlikely to end by the
party&rsquo;s being saved. This again would result in some such
explanation as that contained in our narrative. Naturally, I tried to
record all the actual cases of shipwreck within the natives&rsquo;
memory. Some two generations ago, one of the chiefs of Omarakana, named
Numakala, perished at sea, and with him all his crew. A canoe of
another Eastern Trobriand village, Tilakaywa, was blown far North, and
stranded in Kokopawa, from where it was sailed back by its crew, when
the wind turned to the North-West. Although this canoe was not actually
shipwrecked, its salvation is credited to <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> magic, and to the kind fish, <i lang=
"kij">iraviyaka</i>. A very intelligent informant of mine explained
this point of view in answer to some of my cavillings: &ldquo;If this
canoe had been wrecked, it would have been saved also.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb261" href="#pb261" name=
"pb261">261</a>]</span></p>
<p>A party from Muyuwa (Woodlark Island) were saved on the shore of
Boyowa. In the South of the Island, several cases are on record where
canoes were wrecked and saved in the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux Islands or
in the Amphletts. Once the whole crew were eaten by cannibals, getting
ashore in a hostile district of Fergusson Island, and one man only
escaped, and ran along the shore, south-eastwards towards Dobu. Thus
there is a certain amount of historical evidence for the saving power
of the magic, and the mixture of fanciful and real elements makes our
story a good example of what could be called <i>standardised</i> or
<i>universalised</i> myth&mdash;that is, a myth referring not to one
historical event but to a type of occurrence, happening
universally.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us now give the text of the remaining spells which
belong to the above narrative, but have not been adduced there, so as
not to spoil its flow. First of all there is the <i lang=
"kij">kaytaria</i> spell, that which the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>,
drifting alongside his crew on the detached canoe float, intones in a
loud, slow voice, in order to attract the <i lang=
"kij">iraviyaka</i>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">

<h2 class="main">Kaytaria Spell.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;I lie, I shall lie down in my house, a big
house. I shall sharpen my ear, I shall hear the roaring of the
sea&mdash;it foams up, it makes a noise. At the bottom of Kausubiyai,
come, lift me, take me, bring me to the top of Nabonabwana
beach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then comes a sentence with mythological allusions which I could not
succeed in translating. After that follows the main part of the
spell:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i lang="kij">suyusayu</i> fish shall lift me up; my
child, the <i lang="kij">suyusayu</i> shall lift me up; my
child&rsquo;s things, the <i lang="kij">suyusayu</i> shall lift me up;
my basket, etc.; my lime pot, etc.; my lime spoon, etc.; my house,
etc.;&rdquo; repeating the words &ldquo;the <i lang="kij">suyusayu</i>
fish shall lift me up&rdquo; with various expressions describing the
<i lang="kij">toliwaga&rsquo;s</i> equipment as well as his child,
presumably a member of the shipwrecked crew.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no end part to this spell, as it was given to me; only the
beginning is repeated after the main part. It is not impossible that
Molilakwa himself, my informant, did not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb262" href="#pb262" name="pb262">262</a>]</span>know the spell to the
end. Such magic, once learnt by a native, never used, and recited
perhaps once a year during a mortuary ceremony, or occasionally, in
order to show off, is easily forgotten. There is a marked difference
between the vacillating and uncertain way in which such spells are
produced by informants, and the wonderful precision and the easy flow
with which, for example, the spells, year after year performed in
public, will trip off the tongue of the garden magician.</p>
<p>I cannot give a correct commentary to the mythological names
Kausubiyai and Nabonabwana, in the first part of the spell. What this
part means, whether the reclining individual who hears the noises of
the sea is the magician, or whether it represents the sensations of the
fish who hears the calling for help, I could not make out. The meaning
of the middle part is plain, however. <i lang="kij">Suyusayu</i> is
another name for <i lang="kij">iraviyaka</i>, indeed, its magical name
used only in spells, and not when speaking of it in ordinary
conversations.</p>
<p>The other formula to be given here is the other <i lang=
"kij">giyorokaywa</i> spell, which would be used in spitting the ginger
on the beach after rescue, and also in medicating the herbs, which will
be put on the beach and beaten with a stone. This spell is associated
with the myth of the origin of <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>, which
must be related here, to make the formula clear.</p>
<p>Near the beginning of time, there lived in Kwayawata, one of the
Marshall Bennetts, a family strange to our ideas of family life, but
quite natural in the world of Kiriwinian mythology. It consisted of a
man, Kalaytaytu, his sister, Isenadoga, and the youngest brother, a
dog, Tokulubweydoga. Like other mythological personages, their names
suggest that originally they must have conveyed some sort of
description. <i lang="kij">Doga</i> means the curved, almost circular,
boar&rsquo;s tusk used as ornament. The name of the canine member of
the family might mean something like
Man-with-circular-tusks-in-his-head, and his sister&rsquo;s name,
Woman-ornamented-with-<i lang="kij">doga</i>. The eldest brother has in
his name the word <i lang="kij">taytu</i>, which signifies the staple
food (small yams) of natives, and a verb, <i lang="kij">kalay</i>,
signifying &lsquo;to put on ornaments.&rsquo; Not much profit, however,
can be deduced from this etymology, as far as I can see, for the
interpretation of this myth. I shall quote in a literal translation the
short version of this myth, as I obtained it first, when the
information was volunteered to me by Molilakwa in Oburaku. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name="pb263">263</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">

<div class="divBody">

Tokulubwaydoga. The name of their mother, the mother of Tokulubwaydoga,
is Tobunaygu.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This little fragment gives a good idea of what the first version is,
even of so well fixed a piece of narrative as a myth. It has to be
supplemented by inquiries as to the motives of the behaviour of the
various personages, as to the relations of one event to the other.
Thus, further questions revealed that the elder brother refused to take
the dog with him on this fishing expedition. Tokulubwaydoga then
determined to go all the same, and swam to Digumenu, following the
canoe of his brother. This latter was astonished to see him, but none
the less they went to work together. In fishing, the dog was more
successful than his brother, and thus aroused his jealousy. The man
then refused to take him back. Tokulubwaydoga then jumped into the
water, and again swam and arrived safely in Kwayawata. The point of the
story lies in the fact that the dog was able to do the swimming,
because he knew the <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>, otherwise the
sharks, <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, or other evil things would have
eaten him. He got it from his mother, the lady Tobunaygu, who could
teach him this magic because she was a <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>
herself. Another important point about this myth, also quite omitted
from the first version volunteered to me, is its sociological aspect.
First of all, there is the very interesting incident, unparalleled in
Kiriwinian tradition: the mother of the three belonged to the
Lukwasisiga clan. It was a most incongruous thing for a dog, who is the
animal of the Lukuba clan, to be born into a Lukwasisiga family.
However, there he was, and so he said:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Good, I shall be a Lukuba, this is my
clan.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Now the incident of the quarrel receives its significance in so far
as the dog, the only one to whom the mother gave the <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>, did not hand it over to his brother and sister
who were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb264" href="#pb264" name=
"pb264">264</a>]</span>of the Lukwasisiga clan, and so the magic went
down only the dog&rsquo;s own clan, the Lukuba. It must be assumed
(though this was not known to my informant) that Madokei, who learnt
the magic from the dog, was also a Lukuba man.</p>
<p>Like all mythological mother-ancestresses, Tobunaygu had no husband,
nor does this circumstance call forth any surprise or comment on the
part of the natives, since the physiological aspect of fatherhood is
not known among them, as I have repeatedly observed.</p>
<p>As can be seen, by comparing the original fragment, and the
subsequent amplification by inquiries, the volunteered version misses
out the most important points. The concatenation of events, the origin
of the <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>, the important sociological
details, have to be dragged out of the informant, or, to put it more
correctly, he has to be made to enlarge on points, to roam over all the
subjects covered by the myth, and from his statements then, one has to
pick out and piece together the other bits of the puzzle. On the other
hand, the names of the people, the unimportant statements of what they
did and how they were occupied are unfailingly given.</p>
<p>Let us adduce now the <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i>, which is said
to be derived from the dog, and ultimately from his mother:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Kayga&rsquo;u of Tokulubwaydoga.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Tobunaygu (repeated), Manemanaygu (repeated),
my mother a snake, myself a snake; myself a snake, my mother a snake.
Tokulubwaydoga, Isenadoga, Matagagai, Kalaytaytu; <i lang=
"kij">bulumava&rsquo;u tabugu Madokei</i>. I shall befog the front, I
shall shut off the rear; I shall befog the rear, I shall shut off the
front.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exordium contains at first the invocation of the name of the
<i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, who was the source of the spell. Its
pendant Manemanaygu is, according to my informant, derived from an
archaic word <i lang="kij">nema</i>, equivalent to the present day
<i lang="kij">yama</i>, hand. &ldquo;As the right hand is to the left
one, so is Tobunaygu to Manemanaygu,&rdquo; which was expressed as a
matter of fact in the less grammatically worded form; &ldquo;this right
hand, this left&rdquo; (clapped together) &ldquo;so Tobunaygu,
Manemanaygu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether this analysis of my informant is correct must remain an open
question. It must be remembered that magic is not taken by the natives
as an ethnographic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb265" href="#pb265"
name="pb265">265</a>]</span>document, allowing of interpretations and
developments, but as an instrument of power. The words are there to
act, and not to teach. Questions as to the meaning of magic, as a rule,
puzzled the informants, and therefore it is not easy to explain a
formula or obtain a correct commentary upon it. All the same there are
some natives who obviously have tried to get to the bottom of what the
various words in magic represent.</p>
<p>To proceed with our commentary, the phrase &ldquo;My mother a snake,
etc.,&rdquo; was thus explained to me by Molilakwa: &ldquo;Supposing we
strike a snake, already it vanishes, it does not remain; thus also we
human beings, when <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> catch us, we
disappear.&rdquo; That is, we disappear after having spoken this
magical formula, for in a formula the desired result is always
expressed in anticipation. Molilakwa&rsquo;s description of a
snake&rsquo;s behaviour is, according to my experience, not sound
Natural History, but it probably expresses the underlying idea, namely
the elusiveness of the snake, which would naturally be one of the
metaphorical figures used in the spell.</p>
<p>The string of words following the invocation of the snake are all
mythical names, four of which we found mentioned in the above myth,
while the rest remain obscure. The last-named, that of Modokei, is
preceded by the words <i lang="kij">bulumavau tabugu</i>, which means,
&lsquo;recent spirit of my ancestor,&rsquo; which words are as a rule
used in spells with reference to real grandfathers of the reciters.</p>
<p>The middle part of the spell proceeds:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall cover the eyes of the witches of Kitava; I shall
cover the eyes of the witches of Kumwageya; I shall cover the eyes of
the witches of Iwa; I shall cover the eyes of the witches of Gawa,
etc., etc.,&rdquo; enumerating all the villages and islands renowned
for their witches. This list is again recited, substituting for the
expression &ldquo;I shall cover,&rdquo; in succession, &ldquo;I shall
befog,&rdquo; and &ldquo;dew envelopes.&rdquo; This middle part needs
no commentary.</p>
<p>The end of this formula runs as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall kick thy body, I shall take thy spirit skirt, I shall
cover thy buttocks, I shall take thy mat, a pandanus mat, I shall take
thy mantle. I shall strike thee with my foot, go, fly over Tuma, fly
away. I myself in the sea (here the reciter&rsquo;s name is mentioned),
I shall drift away, well.&rdquo; This last part of the spell is so much
alike to the end of the spell first quoted in this chapter, that no
commentary is needed.</p>

<p>The mythological and magical data presented in this chapter all bear
upon the native belief in flying witches and dangers at sea, a belief
in which elements of reality are strangely blended with traditionally
fixed fancies, in a way, however, not uncommon to human belief in
general. It is time now to return to our party on the beach at Yakum,
who, after having spent the night there, next morning rig up their
masts, and with a favourable wind, soon reach the waters of Gumasila
and Domdom. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb267" href="#pb267" name=

Professor Seligman has described the belief in similar beings on the
North-East Coast of New Guinea. At Gelaria, inland of Bartle Bay, the
flying witches can produce a double, or &ldquo;sending,&rdquo; which
they call <i lang="kij">labuni</i>. &ldquo;<i lang="kij">Labuni</i>
exists within women, and can be commanded by any woman who has had
children&#8202;&hellip;. It was said that the <i lang="kij">labuni</i>
existed in, or was derived from, an organ called <i lang=

eggs.&rdquo; <i>op. cit</i>., p. 640. The equivalence of beliefs here

spells of the old chief Maniyuwa, and one which had been recited when
his corpse was brought over from Dobu by his son Maradiana, was
obtained early in my ethnographic career, and Gomaya, Maradiana&rsquo;s

<p class="first">Our party, sailing from the North, reach first the
main island of Gumasila, a tall, steep mountain with arched lines and
great cliffs, suggesting vaguely some huge Gothic monument. To the
left, a heavy pyramid, the island of Domdom, recedes behind the nearer
mountain as the travellers approach. The fleet now sails along the
westerly shore of Gumasila, on which side the jungle, interspersed with
bald patches, ascends a steep slope, ribbed with rocky ridges, and
creased by valleys which run at their foot into wide bays. Only here
and there can be seen triangular clearings, signs of cultivation made
by the natives from the other side of the island, where the two
villages are situated. At the South-West end of Gumasila, a narrow
promontory runs into a flat, low point with a sandy beach on both
sides. On the North side of the point, hidden from the villages, the
fleet comes to a halt, on the beach of Giyawana (called by the
Trobrianders Giyasila). This is the place where all the fleets,
arriving from the North, stop before approaching the villages. Here
also the inhabitants of the Amphletts rest for a day, after the first
false start they have made from the villages, and before they actually
set off for the Trobriands. This beach, in short, is the Amphlettan
counterpart of the sandbank Muwa. It was also here that I surprised the
Gumasilan canoes on a full moon night, in March, 1918, after they had
started to join the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> expedition to
Sinaketa.</p>
<p>On this beach, the Sinaketans perform the final stage of Kula magic,
before approaching their partners in Gumasila. The same magic will be
repeated before arriving in Dobu, and as a matter of fact, when the
objective of the big <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> is Dobu, the full and
ceremonial performance of the magic might <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb268" href="#pb268" name="pb268">268</a>]</span>usually be deferred
till then. It will be better therefore to postpone the description of
this magic till we have brought our fleet to the beach of Sarubwoyna.
Here it will be enough to mention that on occasions when magic is
performed, after an hour&rsquo;s or half hour&rsquo;s pause on the
beach of Giyawana, all the men get into their canoes, take the paddles
and oars, and the fleet sails round the point where, in a small, very
picturesque bay, there lies the smaller village of Gumasila, called
Nu&rsquo;agasi (see <a href="#pl01">Plate I</a>). This village in olden
days was perched on a narrow ledge some one hundred metres above the
sea level, a fastness difficult of access, and overlooking all its
approaches. Now, after the white man&rsquo;s influence has rendered
unnecessary all precautions against raiding parties, the village has
come down to the narrow strip of foreshore, a bridge between the sea
and a small swamp formed at the foot of the hill. Some of the canoes
will come to this beach, the others will sail further, under a
precipitous black rock of some 150 metres high and 300 metres wide (see
<a href="#pl42">Plate XLII</a>). Turning another corner, they arrive at
the big village of Gumasila, built on artificial stone terraces,
surrounded by dykes of small stones, forming square lagoons and
diminutive harbours (compare the description given above in <a href=
"#div1.5">Chapter I, Division V</a>). This is the old village which,
practically inaccessible by sea, formed a fastness of a different kind
from the other, high-perched villages typical of this district. Exposed
to the full onslaught of the South-Easterly winds and seas, against
which it was protected by its stone bulwarks and dykes, it was
approachable only in all weathers by a small channel to the South,
where a big rock and a reef shelter it from the rough waters.</p>

<p>Without any preliminary welcoming ceremony or formal reception, the
Sinaketan guests now leave their canoes and disperse among the
villagers, settle down in groups near the houses of their friends, and
engage in betel chewing and conversations. They speak in Kiriwinian, a
language which is universally known in the Amphletts. Almost as soon as
they go ashore, they give to their partners presents of <i lang=
"kij">pari</i> (opening gift), some small object, such as a comb, a
lime pot, or a lime stick. After that, they await some Kula gifts to be
given them. The most important headman will offer such a gift first to
Kouta&rsquo;uya, or To&rsquo;udawada, whichever of them is the <i lang=
"kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i> of the occasion. The soft, penetrating
sound of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb269" href="#pb269" name=
"pb269">269</a>]</span>conch-shell soon announces that the first gift
has been given. Other blasts of conch-shells follow, and the Kula is in
full swing. But here again, what happens in the Amphletts, is only a
minor interlude to the Sinaketan adventurers, bent on the bigger goal
in Dobu. And in order for us to remain in harmony with the native
perspective we shall also wait for the detailed and circumstantial
description of the Kula proceedings till we arrive on the beach of
Tu&rsquo;utauna, in Dobu. The concrete account of how such a visiting
fleet is received and behaves on arrival will be given, when I describe
a scene I saw with my own eyes in the village of Nabwageta, another
Amphlett island, when sixty Dobuan canoes arrived there on their
<i lang="fr"><span lang="kij">uvalaku</span>, en route</i> for
Boyowa.</p>
<p>To give a definite idea of the conversations which take place
between the visitors and the Amphlettans, I shall give a sample noted
down, during a visit of some Trobrianders to Nu&rsquo;agasi, the
smaller village of Gumasila. A few canoes had arrived a day or two
before, in the neighbouring island, Nabwageta, coming from the small
Western islands of the Trobriands on a Kula. One of them paddled across
to Nu&rsquo;agasi with a crew of some six men, in order to offer
<i lang="kij">pari</i> gifts to their partners and see what was to be
done in the way of Kula. The canoe was sighted from a distance, and its
purpose was guessed at once, as word had been brought before of the
arrival in Nabwageta of this small expedition. The headman of
Nu&rsquo;agasi, Tovasana, hurried back to his house from my tent, where
I was taking great pains to obtain some ethnographic information from
him.</p>
<p>Tovasana is an outspoken character, and he is the most important
headman in the Amphletts. I am not using the word &lsquo;chief,&rsquo;
for in the Amphletts, as I have said, the natives do not observe either
the court ceremonial with crouching and bending, nor do the headmen
have any power or economic influence, at all comparable with those of
the Trobriands. Yet, although I came from the Trobriands, I was struck
by the authoritative tone used, and the amount of influence evidently
wielded by Tovasana. This is partly due undoubtedly to the lack of
white man&rsquo;s interference, which has so undermined native
authority and morality in the Trobriands, whereas the Amphletts have so
far escaped to a large extent Missionary teaching and Government law
and order. On the other hand, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb270"
href="#pb270" name="pb270">270</a>]</span>however, the very narrow
sphere of his powers, the authority over a small village, consolidates
the headman&rsquo;s influence. The oldest and the most aristocratic by
descent of all the headmen, he is their acknowledged
&lsquo;doyen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In order to receive his visitors he went to the beach in front of
his house and sat there on a log, looking impassively over the sea.
When the Trobrianders arrived each man took a gift and went to his
partner&rsquo;s house. The chief did not rise to meet them, nor did
they come in a body to greet him. The <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> came
towards the place where Tovasana was sitting; he carried a bundle of
taro and a piece of <i lang="kij">gugu&rsquo;a</i> (objects of small
value, such as combs, lime pots, etc.). These he laid down near the
seated headman, who, however, took no notice of it. A small boy, a
grandchild of Tovasana, I think, took up the gifts and put them into
his house. Then, without having yet exchanged a word, the <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> sat down on the platform next to Tovasana. Under a
shady tree, which spread its branches like a canopy above the bleached
canoe, the men formed a picturesque group sitting cross-legged on the
platform. Beside the slim, youthful figure of the Kaduwaga man, the old
Tovasana, with his big, roughly carved features, with his large
aquiline nose sticking out from under an enormous turban-like wig,
looked like an old gnome. At first exchanging merely a word or two,
soon they dropped into more animated conversation, and when other
villagers and the rest of the visitors joined them, the talk became
general. As they spoke in Kiriwinian, I was able to jot down the
beginning of their conversation.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Tovasana asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you anchored?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Nabwageta.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From where did you start on the last day before
arriving?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Gabuwana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day before yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What wind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Started from home with <i lang="kij">yavata</i>; wind
changed. Arrived on sandbank (Gabuwana); we slept; so-and-so made wind
magic; wind changed again; good wind.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271" name="pb271">271</a>]</span></p>
<p>Then Tovasana asked the visitors about one of the chiefs from the
island of Kayleula (to the West of Kiriwina), and when he was going to
give him a big pair of <i lang="kij">mwali</i>. The man answered they
do not know; to their knowledge that chief has no big <i lang=
"kij">mwali</i> at present. Tovasana became very angry, and in a long
harangue, lapsing here and there into the Gumasila language, he
declared that he would never <i lang="kij">kula</i> again with that
chief, who is a <i lang="kij">topiki</i> (mean man), who has owed him
for a long time a pair of <i lang="kij">mwali</i> as <i lang=
"kij">yotile</i> (return gift), and who always is slow in making Kula.
A string of other accusations about some clay pots given by Tovasana to
the same chief, and some pigs promised and never given, were also made
by the angry headman. The visitors listened to it with polite assent,
uttering here and there some noncommital remark. They, in their turn,
complained about some sago, which they had hoped to receive in
Nabwageta, but which was churlishly refused for some reason or other to
all the men of Kaduwaga, Kaysiga and Kuyawa.</p>
<p>Tovasana then asked them, &ldquo;How long are you going to
stay?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till Dobu men come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will come,&rdquo; said Tovasana, &ldquo;not in two days,
not in three days, not in four days; they will come tomorrow, or at the
very last, the day after tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go with them to Boyowa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sail first to Vakuta, then to Sinaketa with the Dobu men.
They sail to Susuwa beach to fish, I go to your villages, to Kaduwaga,
to Kaysiga, to Kuyawa. Is there plenty of <i lang="kij">mwali</i> in
your villages?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there are. So-and-so has&#8202;&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here followed a long string of personal names of big armshells, the
approximate number of smaller, nameless ones, and the names of the
people in whose possession they were at the time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The interest of both hearers and speakers was very obvious, and
Tovasana gave the approximate dates of his movements to his visitors.
Full moon was approaching, and the natives have got names for every day
during the week before and after full moon, and the following and
preceding days can therefore be reckoned. Also, every seven-day period
within a moon is named after the quarter which falls in it. This allows
the natives to fix dates with a fair exactitude. The present example
shows the way in which, in olden times, the movements of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb272" href="#pb272" name=
"pb272">272</a>]</span>various expeditions were known over enormous
areas; nowadays, when white men&rsquo;s boats with native crews often
move from one island to the other, the news spreads even more easily.
In former times, small preliminary expeditions such as the one we have
just been describing, would fix the dates and make arrangements often
for as much as a year ahead.</p>
<p>The Kaduwaga men next inquired as to whether any strangers from the
Trobriands were then staying in Gumasila. The answer was that there was
in the village one man from Ba&rsquo;u, and one from Sinaketa. Then
inquiries were made as to how many Kula necklaces there were in
Gumasila, and the conversation drifted again into Kula
technicalities.</p>
<p>It is quite customary for men from the Trobriands to remain for a
long time in the Amphletts, that is, from one expedition to another.
For some weeks or even months, they live in the house of their partner,
friend, or relative, careful to keep to the customs of the country.
They will sit about with the men of the village and talk. They will
help in the work and go out on fishing expeditions. These latter will
be specially attractive to a Trobriander, a keen fisherman himself, who
here finds an entirely new type of this pursuit. Whether an expedition
would be made on one of the sandbanks, where the fishermen remain for a
few days, casting their big nets for dugong and turtle; or whether they
would go out in a small canoe, trying to catch the jumping gar fish
with a fishing kite; or throwing a fish trap into the deep
sea&mdash;all these would be a novelty to the Trobriander, accustomed
only to the methods suitable to the shallow waters of the Lagoon,
swarming with fish.</p>
<p>In one point the Trobriander would probably find his sojourn in the
Amphletts uncongenial; he would be entirely debarred from any
intercourse with women. Accustomed in his country to easy intrigues,
here he has completely to abstain, not only from sexual relations with
women married or unmarried, but even from moving with them socially, in
the free and happy manner characteristic of Boyowa. One of my main
informants, Layseta, a Sinaketa man, who spent several years in the
Amphletts, confessed to me, not without shame and regret, that he never
succeeded in having any intrigues with the women there. To save his
face, he claimed that he had had several Amphlett belles declaring
their love to him, and offering their favours, but he always refused
them: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb273" href="#pb273" name=
"pb273">273</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;I feared; I feared the <i lang=
"kij">bowo&rsquo;u</i> of Gumasila; they are very bad.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The <i lang="kij">bowo&rsquo;u</i> are the local sorcerers of the
Amphletts. Whatever we might think about Layseta&rsquo;s
temptations&mdash;and his personal appearance and charm do not make his
boastings very credible&mdash;and whether he was afraid of sorcery or
of a sound thrashing, the fact remains that a Trobriander would have to
change his usual mode of behaviour when in the Amphletts, and keep away
from the women entirely. When big parties arrive in Gumasila, or
Nabwageta, the women run away, and camp in the bush till the beach is
clear.</p>
<p>The Amphlettans, on the contrary, were used to receive favours from
unmarried women in Sinaketa. Nowadays, the male inhabitants of that
village, always disapproving of the custom, though not to the extent of
taking any action, tell the Amphlettans that the white man&rsquo;s
Government has prohibited the men from Gumasila and Nabwageta to have
sexual relations in Sinaketa. One of the very few occasions, when the
men from the Amphletts showed any interest in talking to me was when
they asked me whether this was true.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Sinaketa men tell us that we will go to
jail if we sleep with girls in Sinaketa. Would the Government put us
into jail, in truth?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>As usually, I simply disclaimed all knowledge of the white
man&rsquo;s arcana in such matters.</p>
<p>The small party of Kaduwaga men, whose visit to Tovasana I have just
been describing, sat there for about two hours, smoked and chewed
betel-nut, the conversation flagging now and then, and the men looking
into the distance with the habitual self-important expression worn on
such occasions. After the final words about mutual plans were
exchanged, and a few pots had been brought by small boys to the canoe
as <i lang="kij">taio&rsquo;i</i> (farewell gift to the visitors), they
embarked, and paddled back three or four miles across to Nabwageta.</p>
<p>We must imagine the big Kula party from Sinaketa, whom we just
watched landing in the two villages of Gumasila, behaving more or less
in the same manner; conducting similar conversations, offering the same
type of <i lang="kij">pari</i> gifts to their partners. Only everything
happens of course on a much bigger scale. There is a big group seated
before each house, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274"
name="pb274">274</a>]</span>parties walk up and down the village, the
sea in front of it is covered with the gaudy, heavily laden canoes. In
the little village, of which Tovasana is headman, the two chiefs,
To&rsquo;udawada and Kouta&rsquo;uya, will be seated on the same
platform, on which we saw the old man receiving his other guests. The
other headmen of the Sinaketans will have gone to the bigger village
round the corner, and will encamp there under the tall palms, looking
across the straits towards the pyramidal forms of Domdom, and further
South, to the main island fronting them with the majestic form of
Koyatabu. Here, among the small houses on piles, scattered
picturesquely through the maze of little harbours, lagoons and dykes,
large groups of people will be seated on mats of plaited coco-nut, each
man as a rule under the dwelling of his partner, chewing betel-nut
stolidly, and watching stealthily the pots being brought out to be
presented to them, and still more eagerly awaiting the giving of Kula
gifts, although he remains to a superficial glance quite impassive.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In <a href="#ch3">Chapter III</a> I spoke about the
sociology of Kula, and gave a concise definition of partnership with
its functions and obligations. I said there that people enter into this
relationship in a definite manner, and remain in it for the rest of
their life. I also said that the number of partners a man possesses,
depends upon his social position and rank. The protective character of
an overseas partner becomes now clearer, after we have realised the
nervous tension with which each Kula party in olden days would have
approached a land full of <i lang="kij">mulukwausi, bowo&rsquo;u</i>
and other forms of sorcery, a land from which originate the very
<i lang="kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i> themselves.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e9581src" href="#xd26e9581" name="xd26e9581src">1</a> To have a
friend there, one who will not on the surface of it have bad
intentions, is a great boon. What this really means to the natives can,
however, only be realised when we arrive at Dobu, learn the special
safety magic performed there and find how genuinely serious these
apprehensions are.</p>
<p>We must now make another short digression from our consecutive
account, and discuss the several aspects of the sociology of the Kula
one after the other. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275"
name="pb275">275</a>]</span></p>
<p>1. <i>Sociological Limitations to the Participation in the
Kula</i>.&mdash;Not everyone who lives within the cultural sphere of
the Kula does participate in it. More especially in the Trobriand
Islands, there are whole districts which do not practise the Kula. Thus
a series of villages in the North of the main Island, the villages on
the Island of Tuma, as well as the industrial villages of Kuboma and
the agricultural ones of Tilataula do not practise Kula. In villages
like Sinaketa, Vakuta, Gumasila and Nabwageta, every man carries on the
Kula. The same applies to the small Islands which link up the big gaps
of the Kula chain, the Islands of Kitava, Iwa, Gawa and Kwayawata,
strewn on the seas between the Trobriands and Woodlark Island, to
Tubetube and Wari, etc., etc. In the Dobuan speaking district, on the
other hand, I think that certain village complexes either do not
practice Kula at all, or else practice it on a small scale, that is,
their headmen have only a few partners in the neighbouring
villages.</p>
<p>In some of the big chiefs&rsquo; villages in Kiriwina there are
certain people who never practice Kula. Thus, in a village where the
headman has the rank of <i lang="kij">guya&rsquo;u</i> (chief) or
<i lang="kij">gumguya&rsquo;u</i> (minor chief) the commoners of the
lowest rank and unrelated to the headman are not supposed to carry on
the Kula. In olden days this rule would be very strictly observed, and
nowadays even, though somewhat relaxed, not many commoners of this
description practice the Kula. Limitations as to entry into the Kula,
therefore, exist only in big Kula districts such as that of Dobu and of
the Trobriands, and they are partly local, excluding whole villages,
and partly social, excluding certain people of low rank.</p>
<p>2. <i>The Relation of Partnership</i>.&mdash;The name for an
overseas partner is in the Trobriand language <i lang=
"kij">karayta&rsquo;u</i>; &lsquo;my partner&rsquo; is styled <i lang=
"kij">ulo karayta&rsquo;u, ulo</i> being the possessive pronoun of
remote relation. In Gumasila he is called ulo <i lang=
"kij">ta&rsquo;u</i>, which means simply &lsquo;my man&rsquo;; in
Dobuan, <i lang="kij">yegu gumagi</i>. The inland partners are known in
Kiriwinian by the term denoting a friend, &lsquo;<i lang=
"kij">lubaygu</i>,&rsquo; the suffixed possessive pronoun <i lang=
"kij">gu</i> being that of nearest possession.</p>
<p>Only after this relationship has been established between two men,
can the two make Kula with one another. An overseas visitor would as a
rule go to his partner&rsquo;s house and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb276" href="#pb276" name="pb276">276</a>]</span>offer him a small
present as <i lang="kij">pari</i>. This again would be returned by the
local man by means of a <i lang="kij">talo&rsquo;i</i> present. There
would not be any great intimacy between two overseas partners. But, in
sharp contrast to the essential hostility between two strange
tribesmen, such a relationship of friendship would stand out as the
most remarkable deviation from the general rule. In inland relations
between two partners of neighbouring villages, the closeness and
intimacy would be relatively small as compared to other ties. This
relation was defined to me in these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;My partner same as my clansman (<i lang=
"kij">kakaveyogu</i>)&mdash;he might fight me. My real kinsman
(<i lang="kij">veyogu</i>), same navelstring, would always side with
us.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The best way of obtaining detailed information, and of eliminating
any errors which might have crept into ethnographic generalisations, is
to collect concrete data. I have drawn up a complete list of the
partners of Kouta&rsquo;uya, who is one of the biggest Kula men in the
whole Ring; another list of a smaller Sinaketa headman, Toybayoba; and
of course I know several complements of partners of smaller men, who,
as <span class="corr" id="xd26e9652" title="Source: as">a</span> rule,
have about four to six partners each.</p>
<p>The full list of Kouta&rsquo;uya includes fifty-five men in the
Northern Half of Boyowa, that is, in Luba, Kulumata and Kiriwina. From
these the chief receives armshells. To the South, his partners in the
Southern districts of Boyowa and Vakuta are twenty-three by number; in
the Amphletts eleven, and twenty-seven in Dobu. Thus we see that the
numbers to the South and North almost balance, the Southern exceeding
the Northern by six. These numbers include his partners in Sinaketa,
where he makes Kula with all his fellow chiefs, and with all the
headmen of the divisional villages, and in his own little village he
<i>kulas</i> with his sons. But even there, everyone of his partners is
either South or North to him, that is, either gives him the necklaces
or armshells.</p>
<p>All the clans are represented in the list. Often when asked with
regard to the name of some man, why he is in partnership with him, the
answer would be&mdash;&ldquo;Because he is my kinsman,&rdquo; which
means, in this case, clansman of equal rank. Men of other clans are
included, as &lsquo;friends&rsquo; or relatives-in-law, or for some
other reason more or less imaginary. I shall speak <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name=
"pb277">277</a>]</span>presently of the mechanism through which the man
enters on this relation.</p>
<p>The list of Toybayoba&rsquo;s partners includes twelve men to the
North, four in Southern Boyowa, three in the Amphletts and eleven in
Dobu, the balance here also being on the Southern side. As said above,
minor men might have anything between four to ten partners all told,
whereas there are men in northern Boyowa who have only two partners,
one on each side of the ring, so to speak, with whom they make
Kula.</p>
<p>In drawing up these lists, which I shall not reproduce here in
extenso, another striking feature comes to light: on both sides, there
is a definite geographical limit, beyond which a man cannot have any
partners. For all men in the village of Sinaketa, for instance, this
limit, as regards the armshells, coincides with the furthest boundary
of Kiriwina; that is, no man from Sinaketa has any partners in Kitava,
which is the next Kula district beyond Kiriwina. South, in the
direction from which the <i lang="kij">soulava</i> are received, the
villages at the South-East end of Fergusson Island are the last places
where partners of Sinaketan men are still to be found. The small Island
of Dobu itself lies just beyond this boundary, and no man in this
Island or in any of the villages on Normanby Island makes Kula with the
Sinaketans (compare the circles, indicating Kula Communities on
<a href="#map5">Map V</a>).</p>
<p>Beyond these districts, the men still know the names of what could
be called their partners-once-removed, that is, the partners of their
partners. In the case of a man who has only a couple of partners on
each side, who, again being modest men, have also only one or two, this
relationship is not devoid of importance. If I, in Sinaketa, have one
partner, say in Kiriwina, who again has one partner in Kitava, it is no
small matter for me to learn that this Kitava man just obtained a
splendid pair of armshells. For this means that there is about a
quarter of a chance of my receiving these armshells, on the supposition
that the Kitavan and Kiriwinian have two partners each between whom
they can choose in bestowing them. In the case of a big chief like
Kouta&rsquo;uya, however, the number of once-removed partners becomes
so great that they lose any personal significance for him.
Kouta&rsquo;uya has some twenty-five partners in Kiriwina; among them
To&rsquo;uluwa, the big chief, makes Kula with more than half of all
the men in Kitava. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb278" href="#pb278"
name="pb278">278</a>]</span>Some other of Kouta&rsquo;uya&rsquo;s
partners in Kiriwina, of lesser rank, yet quite important, also make
Kula with a great number, so that probably practically everybody in
Kitava is Kouta&rsquo;uya&rsquo;s partner-once-removed.</p>
<p>If we were to imagine that on the Kula Ring there are many people
who have only one partner on each side, then the Ring would consist of
a large number of closed circuits, on each of which the same articles
would constantly pass. Thus if A in Kiriwina always <i>kulas</i> with B
in Sinaketa who <i>kulas</i> with C in Tubetube, who <i>kulas</i> with
D in Murua, who <i>kulas</i> with E in Kitava, who <i>kulas</i> with A
in Kiriwina, then A B C D E F would form such one strand in the big
Kula circuit. If an armshell got into the hands of one of them, it
could never leave this strand. But the Kula Ring is nothing approaching
this, because every small Kula partner has, as a rule, on one side or
the other, a big one, that is a chief. And every chief plays the part
of a shunting-station for Kula objects. Having so many partners on each
side, he constantly transfers an object from one strand to another.
Thus, any article which on its rounds has travelled through the hands
of certain men, may on its second round come through an entirely
different channel. This, of course, supplies a large part of the zest
and excitement of the Kula exchange.</p>
<p>The designation of such a partner-once-removed in the language of
Kiriwina is <i lang="kij">muri-muri</i>. A man will say that such and
such a one is &lsquo;my partner-once-removed,&rsquo; &lsquo;<i lang=
"kij">ulo murimuri</i>.&rsquo; Another expression connected with this
relationship is to inquire &lsquo;whose hand&rsquo; has passed on such
and such a <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>. When To&rsquo;uluwa gives a
pair of armshells to Kouta&rsquo;uya, this latter will ask:
&lsquo;<i lang="kij">availe yamala</i>&rsquo; (&lsquo;whose
hand&rsquo;)? The answer is &lsquo;<i lang="kij">yamala
Pwata&rsquo;i</i>,&rsquo; (&lsquo;the hand of <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e9714" title="Source: Pwatai">Pwata&rsquo;i</span>&rsquo;). And,
as a rule, more or less the following conversation will ensue:
&ldquo;who gave this pair of armshells to Pwata&rsquo;i?&rdquo;
&ldquo;how long were they kept by a man in the Island of Yeguma, and
then distributed on the occasion of a <i lang="kij">so&rsquo;i</i>
(feast)?&rdquo; &ldquo;when they had been the last time in
Boyowa?&rdquo; etc., etc.</p>
<p>3. <i>Entering the Kula Relationship</i>.&mdash;In order to become a
practising member of the Kula, a man must have passed the stage of
adolescence; he must have the status and rank required, that is in such
villages where this condition is demanded; he must know the magic of
the Kula; and last, not least, he <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb279"
href="#pb279" name="pb279">279</a>]</span>must be in possession of a
piece of <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>. The membership, with all its
concomitant implications, may be received from the father, who teaches
his son the magic, gives him a piece of <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, and provides him with a partner, very often in
his own person.</p>
<p>Supposing one of the sons of Kouta&rsquo;uya has reached the stage
where a lad may begin to <i lang="kij">kula</i>. The chief will have
been teaching him the spells for some time already. Moreover the lad,
who from childhood has taken part in overseas expeditions, has many a
time seen the rites performed and heard the spells uttered. When the
time is ripe, Kouta&rsquo;uya, having the conch-shell blown, and with
all due formalities, presents a <i lang="kij">soulava</i> to his son.
This latter, soon afterwards, goes somewhere North. Perhaps he goes
only to one of the neighbouring villages within Sinaketa, perhaps he
accompanies his father on a visit as far North as Omarakana, and in any
case he makes Kula, either with one of his father&rsquo;s friends and
partners, or with a special friend of his own. Thus, at one stroke, the
lad is equipped with magic, <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, and two
partners, one of whom is his father. His northern partner will give him
in due course an armshell, and this he will probably offer to his
father. The transactions once started continue. His father soon gives
him another <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, which he may <i lang=
"kij">kula</i> with the same northern partner, or he may try to
establish another partnership. The next <i lang="kij">mwali</i>
(armshells) he receives from the North, he will probably give to
another partner in the South, and thus establish a new relationship. A
chief&rsquo;s son, who is always a commoner himself (since the chief
cannot marry within his own sub-clan and the son has the status of his
mother), would not multiply his partners beyond the limit numerically
given by the above mentioned partners of Toybayoba.</p>
<p>Not everyone, however, is as fortunate as to be the son of a chief,
which in the Trobriands is, on the whole, one of the most enviable
positions, since it confers many privileges, and entails no special
responsibilities. A young chief himself would have to pay substantially
for establishing his position in the Kula, for a chief is always the
son of a woman of high rank, and the nephew of a chief, though his
father may be a commoner of small influence only. In any case, his
maternal uncle will expect from him some <i lang="kij">pokala</i>
(offerings by instalment), in payment for magic, <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, and finally for a leading position in
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb280" href="#pb280" name=
"pb280">280</a>]</span>the Kula. The young chief would marry, and thus
acquire wealth within limits, and with this he would have to give
presents to his maternal uncle, who in turn would introduce him into
the Kula, exactly as a chief does his son, only not
disinterestedly.</p>
<p>A commoner enters into the Kula like a chief, with the only
exception that everything is on a smaller scale, the amount of the
<i lang="kij">pokala</i> which he gives to his maternal uncle, the
<i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> which he receives, and the number of
partners with whom he <i>kulas</i>. When a man gives to another a piece
of <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, of the Kula kind, but not as a Kula
exchange but as a gift, let us say as <i lang="kij">youlo</i> (gift in
repayment for the harvest supply offerings, see above, <a href=
"#div6.6">Chapter VI, Division VI</a>), this <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> does not leave the Kula Ring. The receiver, if
he had not been in the Kula yet, enters into it by acquiring the
<i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, and can then choose his partner, and
go on with the exchange.</p>
<p>There is one important qualification of the statement made at the
beginning of this section. I said there that a man entering the Kula
Ring, must learn the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> magic. This refers only
to those who practise overseas Kula. For people who do only the inland
exchange, magic is not necessary, and in fact it is never learned by
them.</p>
<p>4. <i>Participation of Women in the Kula</i>.&mdash;As I have said
in the general descriptive chapter on the Kula tribes, the position of
women among them is by no means characterised by oppression or social
insignificance. They have their own sphere of influence, which, in
certain cases and in certain tribes, is of great importance. The Kula,
however, is essentially a man&rsquo;s type of activity. As mentioned
above, in the section between Sinaketa and Dobu, women do not sail on
the big expeditions. From Kiriwina young, unmarried girls would sail
East to Kitava, Iwa, and Gawa, and from these Islands even old, married
women, indeed whole families, come to Kiriwina. But they do not carry
on overseas Kula exchange, neither among themselves, nor with men.</p>
<p>In Kiriwina, some women, notably the chief&rsquo;s wives, are
admitted to the honour and privilege of exchanging <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, though in such cases the transactions are done
<i lang="fr">en famille</i>. To take a concrete case, in October or
November, 1915, To&rsquo;uluwa, the chief of Omarakana, brought a fine
haul of <i lang="kij">mwali</i> from Kitava. The best pair of these he
presented to his veteran wife, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb281"
href="#pb281" name="pb281">281</a>]</span>Bokuyoba, a wife whom he had
inherited from his elder brother Numakala. Bokuyoba in turn gave the
pair, without much delay, to Kadamwasila, the favourite wife of the
chief, the mother of five sons and one daughter. She again gave it to
her son, Namwana Guyau, who <i lang="kij">kula&rsquo;d</i> it on to
some of his southern partners. Next time he receives a <i lang=
"kij">soulava</i> necklace, he will give it, not to his father
directly, but to his mother, who will hand it over to her senior
colleague, and this venerable lady will give it to To&rsquo;uluwa. The
whole transaction is evidently a complimentary interpolation of the two
<i lang="kij">giyovila</i> (chief&rsquo;s wives) in between the simple
transaction of the chief giving the <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> to
his son. This interpolation gives the women much pleasure, and is
highly valued by them. In fact, at that time I heard more about that
than about all the rest of the exchanges associated with this overseas
trip.</p>
<p>In Southern Boyowa, that is in Sinaketa and Vakuta, the r&ocirc;le
of women is similar, but they play besides another part. A man would
sometimes send his wife with a Kula gift to his partner in the
neighbouring village. On some occasions, when he needs <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> very badly, as for instance when he is
expecting some <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> visitors, his wife may help
him to obtain the <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> from that partner.
For, though this latter might refuse to give it to his Sinaketan
partner, he would not do so to his wife. It must be added that no
sexual motives are associated with it, and that it is only a sort of
customary compliment paid to the fair sex.</p>
<p>In Dobu, the wife, or the sister of a man, is always credited with a
great influence over his Kula decisions. Therefore, there is a special
form of magic, used by the Sinaketans, in order to act on the minds of
the Dobuan women. Although, in matters of sex, a Trobriander would have
absolutely to keep aloof from Dobuan women, married or unmarried, he
would approach them with nice speeches and gifts in matters of Kula. He
would reproach an unmarried girl with her brother&rsquo;s conduct
towards him. She would then ask for a piece of <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e9841" title="Source: betel nut">betel-nut</span>. This would be
given with some magic spoken over it, and the girl, it is believed,
would then influence her brother to <i lang="kij">kula</i> with his
partner.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9847src" href="#xd26e9847" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the short outline of the Amphlett tribe which was
given in <a href="#div2.4">Chapter II, Division IV</a>, I called them
&lsquo;typical monopolists,&rsquo; both with reference to their
economic position and to their character. Monopolists they are in two
respects, namely as manufacturers of the wonderful clay pots which form
the only supply for the surrounding districts; and in the second place,
as a commercial community, situated half-way between the populous
country of Dobu, with its rich gardens and coco-nut plantations, on the
one hand, and the Trobriands, the main industrial community in Eastern
New Guinea on the other.</p>
<p>The expression &lsquo;monopolists&rsquo; must, however, be correctly
understood. The Amphletts are not a centre of commercial middle-men,
constantly busy importing and exporting desirable utilities. Only about
once or twice a year, a big expedition comes to their Islands, and
every few months they themselves will sail South-East or North and
again receive visits from smaller expeditions from one of the
neighbours or the other. It is through just such small expeditions that
they collect a <span class="corr" id="xd26e9861" title=
"Source: relattively">relatively</span> considerable amount of
utilities from all surrounding districts, and these they can give to
such visitors as need and desire them. Nor would they impose high
prices on any such exchange, but they are certainly considered less
liberal, less ready to give or to trade and always on the look out for
higher return gifts and extras. In their bartering away of the clay
pots, they also cannot ask extortionate prices, such as, according to
the laws of supply and demand, they could impose on their neighbours.
For, no more than any other natives, can they run counter to customary
rules, which regulate this exchange as much as all others. Indeed,
considering the great amount of trouble which they have in obtaining
the clay, and the high degree of skill necessary to produce the pots,
the prices for which they sell them are very low. But here again, their
manners over this transaction are distinctly haughty, and they are well
aware of their value as potters and distributors of pots to the other
natives.</p>
<p>A few more words must be said about their pot making industry as
well as about the trade in these islands.</p>
<p>The natives of the Amphletts are exclusive manufacturers of pottery,
within a wide radius. They are the only purveyors <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb283" href="#pb283" name="pb283">283</a>]</span>to
the Trobrianders, to the inhabitants of the Marshall Bennett Islands,
and also, I believe, all the <span class="corr" id="xd26e9870" title=
"Source: claypots">clay-pots</span> in Woodlark come from the
Amphletts.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e9873src" href="#xd26e9873" name=
"xd26e9873src">3</a> To the South, they export their pots to Dobu,
Du&rsquo;a&rsquo;u, and further South as far as Milne Bay. This is not
all, however, for although in some of these farther districts the
Amphlett pots are used side by side with other ones, they are
infinitely superior to any earthenware found in the whole of British
New Guinea. Of a large size, yet extremely thin, they possess great
durability, and in form they are extremely well shaped and finished
(see <a href="#pl46">Plate XLVI</a>).</p>
<p>The best Amphlett pots owe their high quality to the excellence of
their material as well as their workmanship. The clay for them has to
be imported into the Islands from Yayawana, a quarry on the Northern
shore of Fergusson Island, about a day&rsquo;s journey from the
Amphletts. Only a very inferior clay can be found in the islands of
Gumasila and Nabwageta, good enough to make small pots, but quite
useless for the big ones.</p>
<p>There is a legend, explaining why the good clay cannot be obtained
nowadays in the Amphletts. In olden days, two brothers, Torosipupu and
Tolikilaki, lived on one of the summits of Gumasila called Tomonumonu.
There was plenty of fine clay there at that time. One day Torosipupu
went to fish with a trap. He caught a very fine giant clam-shell. When
he came back, Tolikilaki said: &ldquo;O my shell! I shall eat
it!&rdquo; Torosipupu refused it and answered with a very obscene
allusion to the bivalvular mollusc and to the uses he was going to make
of it. Tolikilaki asked again; Torosipupu refused. They quarrelled.
Tolikilaki then took part of the clay with him, and went to Yayawana on
the main island. Torosipupu afterwards took the rest and followed him.
What were their further destinies, the legend does not say. But on
Gumasila there remained only very poor clay, which is all that can be
found there ever since.</p>
<p>Since then, the men have to go about twice yearly to Yayawana in
order to bring the clay from which the women afterwards will
manufacture the pots. It takes them about a day to reach Yayawana, to
which, as it lies to the <span class="corr" id="xd26e9891" title=
"Source: South West">South-West</span>, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb284" href="#pb284" name="pb284">284</a>]</span>they can travel with
any of the prevailing winds and return equally well. They remain for a
couple of days there, digging the clay, drying it and filling a few
<i lang="kij">vataga</i> baskets with it. I estimate that each canoe
carries about two ton weight on its return journey. This will last the
women for half a year&rsquo;s production. The pale, straw-coloured clay
is kept under the houses in big troughs made of sides of discarded
canoes.</p>
<p>In olden days, before the white man&rsquo;s advent, the conditions
were a little more complicated. Only one island, Kwatouto, being on
friendly terms with the natives had the freedom of the Northern shore.
Whether the other islands used also to fetch the clay from there, doing
so armed and ready for attack; or whether they used to acquire the clay
by barter from Kwatouto, I could not definitely establish. The
information one receives in the Amphletts is exceedingly
unsatisfactory, and my several informants gave contradictory accounts
on this point. The fact seems clear, in my case, that Kwatouto, then as
now, was the source of the best pottery, but that both Gumasila and
Nabwageta also always manufactured pots, though perhaps inferior ones.
The fourth island, Domdom, never participated in this trade, and up to
the present there is not a single woman in Domdom who can shape a
pot.</p>

</div>
<p>The <span class="corr" id="xd26e9934" title=
"Source: manufucturing">manufacturing</span> of this article, as said,
is exclusively the work of women. They sit in groups of two or three
under the houses, surrounded by big clumps of clay and the implements
of their craft, and produce in these very shabby and mean conditions,
veritable masterpieces of their art. Personally I had only the
opportunity of seeing groups of very old women at work, although I
spent about a month in the Amphletts.</p>
<p>With regard to the technology of pot-making, the method is that of
first roughly moulding the clay into its form and then beating with a
spatula and subsequently scraping the walls to the required thinness
with a mussel-shell. To give the description in detail, a woman starts
first by kneading a certain amount of clay for a long time. Of this
material she makes two semi-circular clumps, or several clumps, if a
big pot is to be made. These clumps are then placed in a ring, touching
one another upon a flat stone or board, so that they form a thick,
circular roll (<a href="#pl44">Plate XLIV</a>, top). The woman now
begins to work this roll with both hands, gradually pressing it
together, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name=
"pb285">285</a>]</span>and at the same time bringing it up all round
into a slanting wall (see <a href="#pl44">Plate XLIV</a>, bottom). Her
left hand works as a rule on the inside, and her right on the outside
of this wall; gradually it begins to shape into a semi-spherical dome.
On the top of the dome there is a hole, through which the woman thrusts
her left hand, working with it on the inside<a id="xd26e9947" name=
"xd26e9947"></a> of the dome (see <a href="#pl45">Plate XLV</a>, top).
At first the main movements of her hands were from downward up,
flattening out the rolls into thin walls. The traces of her fingers
going up and down on the outside leave longitudinal furrows (see
details on <a href="#pl45">Plate XLV</a>, top). Towards the end of this
stage her hands move round and round, leaving concentric, horizontal
marks on the dome. This is continued until the pot has assumed a good
curvature all round.</p>
<p>It seems almost a miracle to see how, in a relatively short time,
out of this after all brittle material, and with no implements
whatever, a woman will shape a practically faultless hemisphere, often
up to a metre in diameter.</p>
<p>After the required shape has been obtained the woman takes a small
spatula of light-wood into her right hand and she proceeds to tap the
clay gently (see <a href="#pl45">Plate XLV</a>, bottom). This stage
lasts a fairly long time, for big pots about an hour. After the dome
has been sufficiently worked in this way small pieces of clay are
gradually fitted in at the top, closing the orifice, and the top of the
dome is beaten again. In the case of small pots the beating is done
only after the orifice has been closed. The pot is put with the mat
into the sun, where it remains for a day or two to harden. It is then
turned round, so that its mouth is now uppermost, and its bottom is
carefully placed into a basket. Then, round the rim of the mouth, a
flat strip of clay is placed horizontally, turned towards the inside,
forming a graceful lip. Three small lumps of clay are put 120&deg;
distance from each other near the lip as ornaments, and, with a pointed
stick, a design is scratched in round the lip and sometimes down the
outside of the body. In this state the pot is again left in the sun for
some length of time.</p>
<p>After it has sufficiently hardened to be handled with safety, though
it must be done with the utmost care, it is placed on some dried
sticks, mouth downwards, supported by stones put between the sticks. It
is surrounded with twigs and pieces of wood on its outside, fire is
kindled, the sticks below bake it from the inside, and those from above
on the outside. The final result is a beautiful pot, of a brick red
colour when new, though after several uses it becomes completely black.
Its shape is not quite semi-spherical; it is rather half an
<span class="corr" id="xd26e9965" title=
"Source: elipsoid">ellipsoid</span>, like the broader half of an egg,
cut off in the middle. The whole gives the feeling of perfection in
form and of elegance, unparalleled in any South Sea pottery<a id=
"xd26e9968" name="xd26e9968"></a> I know (see <a href="#pl46">Plate
XLVI</a>).</p>
<p>These pots in Kiriwinian language <i lang="kij">kuria</i>, are
called by the Amphlett natives <i lang="kij">kuyana</i> or <i lang=
"kij">va&rsquo;ega</i>. The biggest specimens are about a metre across
their mouth, and some sixty centimetres deep; they are used exclusively
for the ceremonial cooking of <i lang="kij">mona</i> (see <a href=
"#pl35">Plate XXXV</a>), and are called <i lang="kij">kwoylamona</i>
(in the Amphletts: <i lang="kij">nokunu</i>). The second size <i lang=
"kij">kwoylakalagila</i> (in the Amphletts, <i lang=
"kij">nopa&rsquo;eva</i>) are used for ordinary boiling of yams or
taro. <i lang="kij">Kwoylugwawaga</i> (Amphletts, <i lang=
"xx">nobadala</i>), are used for the same purposes but are much
smaller. An especial size, <i lang="kij">kwoylamegwa</i> (Amphletts,
<i lang="xx">nosipoma</i>) are used in sorcery. The smallest ones,
which I do not remember ever having seen in the Trobriands though there
is a Trobriand word for them, <i lang="kij">kwoylakekila</i>, are used
for everyday cooking in the Amphletts where they are called <i lang=
"kij">va&rsquo;ega</i>, in the narrower sense of the word.</p>
<p>I have expatiated on this singular and artistic achievement of the
natives of the Amphletts, because from all points of view it is
important to know the details of a craft so far in advance of any
similar achievement within the Melanesian region.</p>
<p>A few words must now be said about trade in the Amphletts. The
central position of this little archipelago situated between, on one
side, the big, flat, extremely fertile coral islands, which, however,
are deprived of many indispensable, natural resources; and on the
other, the rich jungle and varied mineral supplies of the volcanic
regions in the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux archipelago, indicates on which
lines this trade would be likely to develop. To this natural inequality
between them and their neighbours are added social elements. The
Trobrianders are skilful, industrious, and economically highly
organised. In this respect, even the Dobuans stand on a lower level,
and the other inhabitants of the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux much more
so.</p>
<p>If we imagine a commercial diagram drawn on the map, we would first
of all notice the export in pottery, radiating from the Amphletts as
its source. In the inverse direction, flowing <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb287" href="#pb287" name=
"pb287">287</a>]</span>towards them, would be imports in food such as
sago, pigs, coco-nut, betel-nut, taro and yams. An article very
important in olden days, which had to be imported into the Amphletts,
was the stone for implements coming via the Trobriands from Woodlark
Island. These indeed would be traded on by the Amphlettans, as all the
d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux relied, for the most part at least, on the
imports from Woodlark, according to information I obtained in the
Amphletts. The Amphlett islands further depended on the Trobriands for
the following articles: wooden dishes, manufactured in Bwoytalu;
lime-pots manufactured in several villages of Kuboma; three-tiered
baskets and folding baskets, made in Luya; ebony lime pots and mussel
shells, these latter fished mainly by the village of Kavataria in the
lagoon. These articles were paid for, or matched as presents by the
following ones: first of all, of course the pots; secondly,
turtle-shell earrings, special nose sticks, red ochre, <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e10030" title="Source: pummice">pumice</span> stone and
obsidian, all of these obtainable locally. Further, the natives of the
Amphletts procured on Fergusson Island, for the Trobrianders, wild
banana seeds used for necklaces, strips of rattan used as belts and for
lashing, feathers of the cassowary and red parrot, used for dancing
decorations, plaited fibre-belts, bamboo and barbed spears.</p>
<p>It may be added that in olden days, the natives in the Amphletts
would not sail freely to all the places on the main island. Each
Amphlett village community had a district on the mainland, with which
they were on friendly terms and with which they could trade without
incurring any danger. Thus, as said above, only the village of
Kwatouto, in the southernmost inhabited Amphlett island, was free to go
unmolested to the district round Yayawana, from whence they obtained
the pale yellow clay, so excellent for pottery. The natives of
Nabwageta had a few villages eastwards from Yayawana to deal with, and
those of Gumasila went further East still. Domdom natives were never
great traders or sailors. The trading conditions in the islands were
further complicated by the constant internal quarrels and warfare
between the districts. Kwatouto and Domdom on the one side, Gumasila
and Nabwageta on the other were allies, and between these two factions
there was a constant, smouldering hostility, preventing any development
of friendly commercial intercourse, and breaking out now and then into
open warfare. This was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href=
"#pb288" name="pb288">288</a>]</span>the reason why the villages were
all perched on high, inaccessible ledges, or like Gumasila, were built
so as to be protected by the sea and reefs from attack.</p>

</div>
<p>The influence of the surrounding great districts, that is, of the
Trobriands and of Dobu upon the Amphletts neither was nor is merely
commercial. From the limited linguistic material collected in the
Amphletts, I can only say that their language is related both to that
of the Trobriands and of Dobu. Their social organisation resembles
closely that of the Trobrianders with the exception of chieftainship,
which is lacking in the Amphletts. In their beliefs as to sorcery,
spirits, etc., they seem to be more akin to the Dobuans than to the
Trobrianders. Their canoe magic has come <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e10067" title="Source: form">from</span> the Trobriands, but the
art of building their canoes is that of Dobu, which as we have seen
before is also the one adopted by the Trobrianders. The magic of the
Kula, known in the Amphletts, is partly adopted from the Trobriands,
and partly from Dobu. There is only one indigenous system of magic
which originated in the islands. Long ago there lived a man of the
Malasi clan, who had his abode in the rock of Selawaya, which stands
out of the jungle, above the big village of Gumasila. This man knew the
magic of <i lang="kij">ayowa</i>, which is the name given to <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i> (Kula magic) in the language of the Amphletts and of
Dobu. Some people passed near the stone while it was being recited
within it; they learned it, and handed it over to their
descendants.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One more point of importance must be mentioned here, a
point bearing upon the intertribal relations in this district. As we
saw, some Trobriand people remain sometimes on prolonged visits in the
Amphletts. This custom, however, is never reciprocated, and people from
the Amphletts never visit for any length of time their Northern
neighbours. The same refers to the relations between the Trobriands and
the district of Dobu. In discussing the lists of Kula partners of
Kouta&rsquo;uya and Toybayoba, I was told about some of their Southern
partners, that they were <i lang="kij">veyola</i> (maternal kinsmen) of
my informant. On further inquiry it appeared that these people were
emigrants from the Trobriands, who settled down in Tewara, Sanaroa or
the big Dobuan settlements on the North-West shores of Dawson Straits.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb289" href="#pb289" name=
"pb289">289</a>]</span></p>
<p>When I asked whether, on the contrary, there were any cases of
Dobuans settling in Boyowa, it was emphatically denied that such a
thing could happen. And indeed, in the numerous genealogical data which
I have collected from all over the district, there is no trace of
migration from the South, although frequent migrations occur within the
district and some from the Marshall Bennett Islands. In general, all
these migrations within the Trobriands show also a marked tendency to
move form North to South. Thus, the most aristocratic sub-clan, the
Tabalu, originated in the Northernmost village of Laba&rsquo;i. But now
their stronghold is further South in Omarakana, and the members of the
same sub-clan are ruling in Olivilevi, and Tukwa&rsquo;ukwa, that is in
the middle of the island. Some of them even migrated as far South as
Vakuta, where they established a feeble imitation of chieftainship,
never being able to subdue the other natives to any extent. Several
sub-clans, now firmly established in the Middle and Southern portions
of the island, trace their descent from the North, and in the Amphletts
there are also a couple of cases of sub-clans immigrated from
Boyowa.</p>
<p>In contrast to this migration of people from North to South, we have
noted the spread of one of the main cultural elements, of the canoe,
from South to North. We saw how the <i lang="kij">nagega</i>, the big,
sea-worthy, but heavy and slow canoe has been superseded by the
<i lang="kij">masawa</i> or <i lang="kij">tadobu</i>, which spread a
few generations ago, till it arrived at the island of Kitava. It is
more difficult to follow the movements of beliefs. But I have reason to
assume that beliefs in sorcery, more especially in the <i lang=
"kij">mulukwausi</i> and <i lang="kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i>, move from
South to North.</p>
<p>In the <a href="#ch12">next Chapter</a>, we shall return to our
Sinaketan expedition, in order to move them for a short distance along
their route into the first settlements of the Dobu speaking people.
These places will suggest a new theme for a lengthy digression, this
time into the mythological subjects and legends connected with the
Kula. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb290" href="#pb290" name=

<p class="first">At daybreak the party leave the Amphletts. This is the
stage when the parting gifts, the <i lang="kij">talo&rsquo;i</i> are
given. The clay pots, the several kinds of produce of the islands and
of the Koya, which had been laid aside the previous day, are now
brought to the canoes (see <a href="#pl47">Plate XLVII</a>). Neither
the giver nor the main receiver, the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>, take
much notice of the proceedings, great nonchalance about give and take
being the correct attitude prescribed by good manners. Children bring
the objects, and the junior members of the crew stow them away. The
general behaviour of the crowds, ashore and in the canoes, is as
unostentatious at this moment of parting as it was at the arrival. No
more farewells than greetings are spoken or shouted, nor are there any
visible or formal signs of grief, or of hope of meeting again, or of
any other emotions. The busy, self-absorbed crews push off stolidly,
step the mast, set sail, and glide away.</p>
<p>They now approach the broad front of Koyatabu, which with a
favourable wind, they might reach within two hours or so. They probably
sail near enough to get a clear view of the big trees standing on the
edge of the jungle, and of the long waterfall dividing the
mountain&rsquo;s flank right down the middle; of the triangular patches
under cultivation, covered with the vine of yams and big leaves of
taro. They could also perceive here and there smoke curling out of the
jungle where, hidden under the trees, there lies a village, composed of
a few miserable huts. Nowadays these villages have come down to the
water&rsquo;s edge, in order to supplement their garden yield with
fish. In olden days they were all high up on the slope, and their huts
hardly ever visible from the sea. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291"
href="#pb291" name="pb291">291</a>]</span></p>
<p>The inhabitants of these small and ramshackle villages are shy and
timid, though in olden days they would have been dangerous to the
Trobrianders. They speak a language which differs from that of Dobu and
is usually called by the natives &lsquo;the Basima talk.&rsquo; There
seem to be about four or five various languages on the island of
Fergusson, besides that of Dobu. My acquaintance with the Basima
natives is very small, due only to two forced landings in their
district. They struck me as being physically of a different type from
the Dobuans, though this is only an impression. They have got no boats,
and do the little sailing they require on small rafts of three or five
logs tied together. Their houses are smaller and less well-made than
those in Dobu. Further investigation of these natives would be very
interesting, and probably also very difficult, as is always the case
when studying very small communities, living at the same time right out
of touch with any white man.</p>
<p>This land must remain, for the present anyhow, veiled for ourselves,
as it also is for the Trobriand natives. For these, indeed, the few
attempts which they occasionally made to come into contact with these
natives, and the few mishaps which brought them to their shores, were
all far from encouraging in results, and only strengthened the
traditional superstitious fear of them. Several generations ago, a
canoe or two from Burakwa, in the island of Kayeula, made an exploring
trip to the district of Gabu, lying in a wide bay under the North-West
flank of Koyatabu. The natives of Gabu, receiving them at first with a
show of interest, and pretending to enter into commercial relations,
afterwards fell on them treacherously and slew the chief Toraya and all
his companions. This story has become famous, and indeed one of the
outstanding historical events of the Trobriands, because Tomakam, the
slain chief&rsquo;s younger brother, went to the Koya of Gabu, and
killed the head man of one of the villages, avenging thus his
brother&rsquo;s death. He then composed a song and a dance which is
performed to this day in Kiriwina, and has indeed one of the finest
melodies in the islands.</p>
<p>This is the verbatim account of the story as it was told to me by
To&rsquo;uluwa himself, the chief of Omarakana, who at present
&lsquo;owns&rsquo; this Gumagabu dance, his ancestors having acquired
it from the descendants of Tomakam by a <i lang="kij">laga</i>

also the theme of the song.</p>

<p class="first">&ldquo;Tomakam got a new <i lang="kij">waga</i>. He
blew the conch shell and went to the Koya. He spoke to his
mother&rdquo; (that is, before leaving), &ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;My
mother, you remain, I shall sail. One conch shell you hear, it will be
a conch shell of a necklace.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; (That is, it will be
a sign that he has been successful in getting a good Kula necklace).
&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;The second conch shell will be the conch shell of
the dead man; the sign that I have already carried out my revenge. I
shall sail, I shall anchor, I shall sleep. The second day I shall sail,
I shall anchor, I shall sleep. The third day I shall anchor in a
village, having already arrived in the Mountain. The fourth day I shall
give <i lang="kij">pari</i>, the <i lang="kij">Kinana</i> (the Southern
foreigner) will come, I shall hit him. The fifth day I shall return. I
shall sail fast, till night grows on the sea. The next day I shall
anchor at Burakwa. You hear the conch shell, you sleep in the house,
arise. One blow you hear of the shell&mdash;the blow of the <i lang=
"kij">bagi</i> (necklace). Two blows you hear, the blow of the dead
man! Then the men of Burakwa will say: &lsquo;Two conch shells, two
necklaces,&rsquo; then, you come out of the house, you speak:
&lsquo;Men of Burakwa, from one side of the village and from the other;
indeed you mocked my son, Tomakam. Your speech was&mdash;go, carry out
thy vendetta in Gabu. The first conch shell is that of the necklace,
the second conch shell is that of the dead man. I have
spoken!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; (Here ends the speech of Tomakam to his
mother.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;He anchored in the village in the Koya. He told his younger
brother: &lsquo;Go, tell the <i lang="kij">Kinana</i> men these words:
Your friend has a sore leg, well, if we together go to the canoe he
will give the <i lang="kij">pari!</i>&rsquo; The younger brother went
and spoke those words to the headman of the <i lang="kij">Kinana</i>:
&lsquo;Some green coco-nuts, some betel-nut, some pig, bring this to us
and we shall give you <i lang="kij">pari</i>. Your arm-shells, your big
stone blade, your boar&rsquo;s tusk, your whale-bone spatula await you
in the canoe. The message for you is that your friend has a sore leg
and cannot walk.&rsquo; Says the <i lang="kij">Kinana</i> man:
&lsquo;Well, let us go!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He caught a pig, he collected betel-nut, sugar cane, bananas,
necklaces, betel-pod, he said: &lsquo;Well, let us go <span class=

"kij">Pu&rsquo;u</i> he gives the necklace; <i lang=
"kij">pu&rsquo;u</i>, the pig; then he gave the coco-nut, the
betel-nut, the sugar cane, the bananas. Tomakam lay on one side; his
leg he wrapped up in a white, soft pandanus mat. Before he had spoken
to his younger brother&rdquo;: (i.e., he gave him this instruction
also, when he sent him to meet the people of Gabu):
&ldquo;&#8202;&lsquo;You all come with the <i lang="kij">Kinana</i>
man. Do not remain in the village.&rsquo; Then&rdquo; (after the first
gifts were exchanged) &ldquo;the <i lang="kij">Kinana</i> man stood up
in the canoe. His betel-pod fell down. Spoke Tomakam, addressing the
<i lang="kij">Kinana</i> man: &lsquo;My friend, pick up the betel-pod.
It fell and went down into the canoe.&rsquo; The <i lang=
"kij">Kinana</i> man bent down, he took the betel-pod. Tomakam saw that
the <i lang="kij">Kinana</i> bent down, he took an axe, and sitting he
made a stroke at him. He cut off his neck. Then Tomakam took the head,
threw the body into the sea. The head he stuck on a stick of his canoe.
They sailed, they arrived in their village. He caught a pig, prepared a
taro pudding, cut sugar cane, they had a big feast, he invented this
song.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was the story told me by the chief of Omarakana about the song
and dance of Gumagabu, which at that time they were singing and
performing in his village. I have adduced it in full, in an almost
literal translation from the native text, in order to show it side by
side with the song. The narrative thus reproduced shows characteristic
gaps, and it does not cover even the incidents of the song.</p>
<p>The following is a free translation of the song, which, in its
original native text, is very condensed and impressionistic. A word or
two indicates rather than describes whole scenes and incidents, and the
traditional commentary, handed on in a native community side by side
with the song, is necessary for a full understanding.</p>

<p>The character of this song is extremely elliptic, one might even say
futuristic, since several scenes are crowded simultaneously into the
picture. In the first strophe we see the <i lang="kij">Kinana</i>, by
which word all the tribesmen from the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux Archipelago
are designated in Boyowa, on the top of his Mountain in Gabu.
Immediately afterwards, we are informed of the intentions of Tomakam to
ascend the mountain, while the women cry for Toraya, for the slain
chief&mdash;probably his kinswomen and widows. The next picture again
spans over the wide seas, and on the one shore we see the Gabuan
sitting on the slopes of his hill and far away on the other, under the
fringe of small clouds lifting above Boyowa, the mother cries for her
son, the murdered chief. Tomakam takes a resolve, &lsquo;I shall take
my revenge,&rsquo; hearing her cry.</p>
<p>In the second strophe, the mother dreams about the expedition; the
words about revenge to be taken on the Gabu men and the directions to
anchor and hit him are probably taken from her dream. Then suddenly we
are transported right across to the mountain, the expedition having
arrived there already. The strangers, the <i lang="kij">Kinana</i> are
coming down to the canoe, and we assist at the words spoken between
them and the people of Buakwa.</p>
<p>Then in the third strophe, we arrive at the culminating scene of the
drama; even here, however, the hero, who is also his own bard, could
not help introducing a few boastful words about his renown resounding
in the Koya. In a few words the tragedy is described: the <i lang=
"kij">Kinana</i> bends down, is killed, and his body is thrown into the
water. About his head we hear nothing in this verse.</p>
<p>In the next one, a storm overtakes the returning party. Signals of
distress are re-echoed by the mountain, and like Homeric heroes, our
party are not ashamed to weep in fear and anguish. Somehow they escape,
however, and in the next verse, they are already near their village and
Tomakam, their leader, bursts into a p&aelig;an of triumph. It is not
quite clear what the allusion to the basket means, whether he keeps
there his Kula trophies or the slain enemy&rsquo;s head; this latter,
in contradiction to what we heard in the prose story of its being
impaled. The song ends with a description of a feast. The woman
mentioned there is Tomakam&rsquo;s daughter, who puts on festive attire
in order to welcome her father. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb296"
href="#pb296" name="pb296">296</a>]</span></p>
<p>Comparing now the song with the story, we see that they do not quite
tally. In the story, there is the dramatic interest of the
mother&rsquo;s intervention. We gather from it that Tomakam, goaded by
the aspersions of his fellow-villagers, wishes to make his return as
effective as possible. He arranges the signals of the two conch shell
blasts with his mother, and asks her to harangue the people at the
moment of his return. All this finds no expression in the song. The
ruse of the chief&rsquo;s sore leg is also omitted from there, which,
however, does not mean that the hero was ashamed of it. On the other
hand, the storm described in the song is omitted from the story, and
there is a discrepancy about the head of the Gabu man, and we do not
know whether it really is conveyed in a basket as the song has it or
impaled, as the story relates!</p>
<p>I have adduced in detail the story and the song, because they are a
good illustration of the native&rsquo;s attitude towards the dangers,
and towards the heroic romance of the Koya. They are also interesting
as documents, showing which salient points would strike the
natives&rsquo; imagination in such a dramatic occurrence. Both in the
story and in the song, we find emphasised the motives of social duty,
of satisfied self-regard and ambition; again, the dangers on the reef,
the subterfuge in killing, finally the festivities on return home. Much
that would interest us in the whole story is omitted, as anyone can see
for himself.</p>
<p>Other stories, though not made illustrious through being set into a
song, are told about the Koya. I met myself an old man in the island of
Vakuta, who, as a boy, had been captured with a whole party by a
village community of Dobu-speaking people on Normanby Island. The men
and another small boy of the party were killed and eaten, but some
women took pity on him, and he was spared, to be brought up amongst
them. There is another man, either alive or recently dead in Kavataria,
who had a similar experience in Fergusson Island. Another man called
Kaypoyla, from the small island of Kuyawa in the Western Trobriands,
was stranded with his crew somewhere in the West of Fergusson Island,
but not in the district where they used to trade. His companions were
killed and eaten. He was taken alive and kept to fatten for a proximate
feast. His host, or rather the host of the feast in which he was going
to furnish the <i lang="fr">pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistence</i>, was
away inland, to invite the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb297" href=
"#pb297" name="pb297">297</a>]</span>guests, while the host&rsquo;s
wife went for a moment behind the house, sweeping the ground. Kaypoyla
jumped up and ran to the shore. Being chased by some other men from the
settlement, he concealed himself in the branches of a big tree standing
on the beach, and was not found by his pursuers. At night he came down,
took a canoe or a raft, and paddled along the coast. He used to sleep
on shore during the night, and paddle on in day time. One night he
slept among some sago-palms, and, awakening in the morning, found
himself, to his terror, surrounded by <i lang="kij">Kinana</i> men.
What was his joyful surprise after all, when he recognised among them
his friend and Kula partner, with whom he always used to trade! After
some time, he was sent back home in his partner&rsquo;s canoe.</p>
<p>Many such stories have a wide currency, and they supply one of the
heroic elements in tribal life, an element which now, with the
establishment of white man&rsquo;s influence, has vanished. Yet even
now the gloomy shores which our party are leaving to the right, the
tall jungle, the deep valleys, the hill-tops darkened with trailing
clouds, all this is a dim mysterious background, adding to the awe and
solemnity of the Kula, though not entering into it. The sphere of
activities of our traders lies at the foot of the high mountains,
there, where a chain of rocks and islands lies scattered along the
coast. Some of them are passed immediately after leaving Gumasila.
Then, after a good distance, a small rock, called Gurewaya, is met,
remarkable for the taboos associated with it. Close behind it, two
islands, Tewara and Uwama, are separated by a narrow passage, the
mythical straits of Kadimwatu. There is a village on the
first-mentioned, and the natives of this make gardens on both islands.
The village is not very big; it may have some sixty to eighty
inhabitants, as it can man three canoes for the Kula. It has no
commercial or industrial importance, but is notable because of its
mythological associations. This island is the home of the mythological
hero, Kasabwaybwayreta, whose story is one of the most important
legends of the Kula. Here indeed, in Tewara, we are right within the
mythological heart of the Kula. In fact, we entered its legendary area
with the moment the Sinaketan fleet sailed out of the Lagoon into the
deep waters of Pilolu. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb298" href=

<p class="first">Once more we must pause, this time in an attempt to
grasp the natives&rsquo; mental attitude towards the mythological
aspect of the Kula. Right through this account it has been our constant
endeavour to realise the vision of the world, as it is reflected in the
minds of the natives. The frequent references to the scenery have not
been given only to enliven the narrative, or even to enable the reader
to visualise the setting of the native customs. I have attempted to
show how the scene of his actions appears actually to the native, to
describe his impressions and feelings with regard to it, as I was able
to read them in his folk-lore, in his conversations at home, and in his
behaviour when passing through this scenery itself.</p>
<p>Here we must try to reconstruct the influence of myth upon this vast
landscape, as it colours it, gives it meaning, and transforms it into
something live and familiar. What was a mere rock, now becomes a
personality; what was a speck on the horizon becomes a beacon, hallowed
by romantic associations with heroes; a meaningless configuration of
landscape acquires a significance, obscure no doubt, but full of
intense emotion. Sailing with natives, especially with novices to the
Kula, I often observed how deep was their interest in sections of
landscape impregnated with legendary meaning, how the elder ones would
point and explain, the younger would gaze and wonder, while the talk
was full of mythological names. It is the addition of the human
interest to the natural features, possessing in themselves less power
of appealing to a native man than to us, which makes the difference for
him in looking at the scenery. A stone hurled by one of the heroes into
the sea after an escaping canoe; a sea passage broken between two
islands by a magical canoe; here two people turned into rock; there a
petrified <i lang="kij">waga</i>&mdash;all this makes the landscape
represent a continuous story or else the culminating dramatic incident
of a familiar legend. This power of transforming the landscape, the
visible environment, is one only of the many influences which myth
exercises upon the general outlook of the natives. Although here we are
studying myth only in its connection with the Kula, even within these
narrow limits some of its broader connections will be apparent, notably
its influence upon sociology, magic and ceremonial.</p>
<p>The question which presents itself first, in trying to grasp
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb299" href="#pb299" name=
"pb299">299</a>]</span>the native outlook on the subject is: what is
myth to the natives? How do they conceive and define it? Have they any
line of demarcation between the mythical and the actual reality, and if
so, how do they draw this line?</p>
<p>Their folk-lore, that is, the verbal tradition, the store of tales,
legends, and texts handed on by previous generations, is composed of
the following classes: first of all, there is what the natives call
<i lang="kij">libogwo</i>, &lsquo;old talk,&rsquo; but which we would
call tradition; secondly, <i lang="kij">kukwanebu</i>, fairy tales,
recited for amusement, at definite seasons, and relating avowedly
untrue events; thirdly, <i lang="kij">wosi</i>, the various songs, and
<i lang="kij">vinavina</i>, ditties, chanted at play or under other
special circumstances; and last, not least, <i lang="kij">megwa</i> or
<i lang="kij">yopa</i>, the magical spells. All these classes are
strictly distinguished from one another by name, function, social
setting, and by certain formal characteristics. This brief outline of
the Boyowan folk-lore in general must suffice here, as we cannot enter
into more details, and the only class which interests us in the present
connection is the first one, that called <i lang="kij">libogwo</i>.</p>
<p>This, the &lsquo;old talk,&rsquo; the body of ancient tradition,
believed to be true, consists on the one hand of historical tales, such
as the deeds of past chiefs, exploits in the Koya, stories of
shipwreck, etc. On the other hand, the <i lang="kij">libogwo</i> class
also contains what the natives call <i lang=
"kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>&mdash;myths, narratives, deeply believed by
them, held by them in reverence, and exercising an active influence on
their conduct and tribal life. Now the natives distinguish definitely
between myth and historic account, but this distinction is difficult to
formulate, and cannot be stated but in a somewhat deliberate
manner.</p>
<p>First of all, it must be borne in mind, that a native would not
trouble spontaneously to analyse such distinctions and to put them into
words. If an Ethnographer succeeded in making the problem clear to an
intelligent informant (and I have tried and succeeded in doing this)
the native would simply state:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;We all know that the stories about Tudava,
about Kudayuri, about Tokosikuna, are <i lang="kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>;
our fathers, our <i lang="kij">kadada</i> (our maternal uncles) told us
so; and we always hear these tales; we know them well; we know that
there are no other tales besides them, which are <i lang=
"kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>. Thus, whenever we hear a story, we know whether
it is a <i lang="kij">lili&rsquo;u</i> or not.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb300" href="#pb300" name=
"pb300">300</a>]</span></p>
<p>Indeed, whenever a story is told, any native, even a boy, would be
able to say whether this is one of his tribal <i lang=
"kij">lili&rsquo;u</i> or not. For the other tales, that is the
historical ones, they have no special word, but they would describe the
events as happening among &lsquo;humans like ourselves.&rsquo; Thus
tradition, from which the store of tales is received, hands them on
labelled as <i lang="kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>, and the definition of a
<i lang="kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>, is that it is a story transmitted with
such a label. And even this definition is contained by the facts
themselves, and not explicitly stated by the natives in their current
stock of expressions.</p>
<p>For us, however, even this is not sufficient, and we have to search
further, in order to see whether we cannot find other indices, other
characteristic features which differentiate the world of mythical
events from that of real ones. A reflection which would naturally
present itself would be this: &ldquo;Surely the natives place their
myths in ancient, pre-historic times, while they put historical events
into recent ages?&rdquo; There is some truth in this, in so far as most
of the historical events related by the natives are quite recent, have
occurred within the community where they are told and can be directly
connected with people and conditions existing at present, by memory of
living man, by genealogies or other records. On the other hand, when
historical events are told from other districts, and cannot be directly
linked with the present, it would be erroneous to imagine that the
natives place them into a definite compartment of time different from
that of the myth. For it must be realised that these natives do not
conceive of a past as of a lengthy duration, unrolling itself in
successive stages of time. They have no idea of a long vista of
historical occurrences, narrowing down and dimming as they recede
towards a distant background of legend and myth, which stands out as
something entirely different from the nearer planes. This view, so
characteristic of the naive, historical thinking among ourselves, is
entirely foreign to the natives. Whenever they speak of some event of
the past, they distinguish whether it happened within their own memory
or that of their fathers&rsquo; or not. But, once beyond this line of
demarcation, all the past events are placed by them on one plane, and
there are no gradations of &lsquo;long ago&rsquo; and &lsquo;very long
ago.&rsquo; Any idea of epochs in time is absent from their mind; the
past is one vast storehouse of events, and the line of demarcation
between myth <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href="#pb301" name=
"pb301">301</a>]</span>and history does not coincide with any division
into definite and distinct periods of time. Indeed, I have found very
often that when they told me some story of the past, for me obviously
mythological, they would deem it necessary to emphasise that this did
not happen in their fathers&rsquo; time or in their
grand-fathers&rsquo; time, but long ago, and that it is a <i lang=
"kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>.</p>
<p>Again, they have no idea of what could be called the evolution of
the world or the evolution of society; that is, they do not look back
towards a series of successive changes, which happened in nature or in
humanity, as we do. We, in our religious and scientific outlook alike,
know that earth ages and that humanity ages, and we think of both in
these terms; for them, both are eternally the same, eternally youthful.
Thus, in judging the remoteness of traditional events, they cannot use
the co-ordinates of a social setting constantly in change and divided
into epochs. To give a concrete example, in the myths of Torosipupu and
Tolikalaki, we saw them having the same interest and concerns, engaged
in the same type of fishing, using the same means of locomotion as the
present natives do. The mythical personages of the natives&rsquo;
legends, as we shall presently see, live in the same houses, eat the
same food, handle the same weapons and implements as those in use at
present. Whereas in any of our historical stories, legends or myths, we
have a whole set of changed cultural conditions, which allow us to
co-ordinate any event with a certain epoch, and which make us feel that
a distant historical event, and still more, a mythological one, is
happening in a setting of cultural conditions entirely different from
those in which we are living now. In the very telling of the stories
of, let us say, Joan of Arc, Solomon, Achilles, King Arthur, we have to
mention all sorts of things and conditions long since disappeared from
among us, which make even a superficial and an uneducated listener
realise that it is a story of a remote and different past.</p>
<p>I have said just now that the mythical personages in the Trobriand
tradition are living the same type of life, under the same social and
cultural conditions as the present natives. This needs one
qualification, and in this we shall find a very remarkable criterion
for a distinction between what is legendary and what is historical: in
the mythical world, although <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb302" href=
"#pb302" name="pb302">302</a>]</span>surrounding conditions were
similar, all sorts of events happened which do not happen nowadays, and
people were endowed with powers such as present men and their
historical ancestors do not possess. In mythical times, human beings
come out of the ground, they change into animals, and these become
people again; men and women rejuvenate and slough their skins; flying
canoes speed through the air, and things are transformed into
stone.</p>
<p>Now this line of demarcation between the world of myth and that of
actual reality&mdash;the simple difference that in the former things
happen which never occur nowadays&mdash;is undoubtedly felt and
realised by the natives, though they themselves could not put it into
words. They know quite well that to-day no one emerges from
underground; that people do not change into animals, and <i lang=
"la">vice versa</i>; nor do they give birth to them; that present-day
canoes do not fly. I had the opportunity of grasping their mental
attitude towards such things by the following occurrence. The Fijian
missionary teacher in Omarakana was telling them about white
man&rsquo;s flying machines. They inquired from me, whether this was
true, and when I corroborated the Fijian&rsquo;s report and showed them
pictures of aeroplanes in an illustrated paper, they asked me whether
this happened nowadays or whether it were a <i lang=
"kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>. This circumstance made it clear to me then,
that the natives would have a tendency, when meeting with an
extraordinary and to them supernatural event, either to discard it as
untrue, or relegate it into the regions of the <i lang=
"kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>. This does not mean, however, that the untrue
and the mythical are the same or even similar to them. Certain stories
told to them, they insist on treating as <i lang="kij">sasopa</i>
(lies), and maintain that they are not <i lang="kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>.
For instance, those opposed to missionary teaching will not accept the
view that Biblical stories told to them are a <i lang=
"kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>, but they reject them as <i lang=
"kij">sasopa</i>. Many a time did I hear such a conservative native
arguing thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Our stories about Tudava are true; this is a
<i lang="kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>. If you go to Laba&rsquo;i you can see
the cave in which Tudava was born, you can see the beach where he
played as a boy. You can see his footmark in a stone at a place in the
Raybwag. But where are the traces of Yesu Keriso? Who ever saw any
signs of the tales told by the misinari? Indeed they are not <i lang=
"kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href="#pb303" name=
"pb303">303</a>]</span></p>
<p>To sum up, the distinction between the <i lang=
"kij">lili&rsquo;u</i> and actual or historical reality is drawn
firmly, and there is a definite cleavage between the two. <i lang=
"la">Prima facie</i>, this distinction is based on the fact that all
myth is labelled as such and known to be such to all natives. A further
distinctive mark of the world of <i lang="kij">lili&rsquo;u</i> lies in
the super-normal, supernatural character of certain events which happen
in it. The supernatural is believed to be true, and this truth is
sanctioned by tradition, and by the various signs and traces left
behind by mythical events, more especially by the magical powers handed
on by the ancestors who lived in times of <i lang=
"kij">lili&rsquo;u</i>. This magical inheritance is no doubt the most
palpable link between the present and the mythical past. But this past
must not be imagined to form a pre-historic, very distant background,
something which preceded a long evolution of mankind. It is rather the
past, but extremely near reality, very much alive and true to the
natives.</p>
<p>As I have just said, there is one point on which the cleavage
between myth and present reality, however deep, is bridged over in
native ideas. The extraordinary powers which men possess in myths are
mostly due to their knowledge of magic. This knowledge is, in many
cases, lost, and therefore the powers of doing these marvellous things
are either completely gone, or else considerably reduced. If the magic
could be recovered, men would fly again in their canoes, they could
rejuvenate, defy ogres, and perform the many heroic deeds which they
did in ancient times. Thus, magic, and the powers conferred by it, are
really the link between mythical tradition and the present day. Myth
has crystallised into magical formul&aelig;, and magic in its turn
bears testimony to the authenticity of myth. Often the main function of
myth is to serve as a foundation for a system of magic, and, wherever
magic forms the backbone of an institution, a myth is also to be found
at the base of it. In this perhaps, lies the greatest sociological
importance of myth, that is, in its action upon institutions through
the associated magic. The sociological point of view and the idea of
the natives coincide here in a remarkable manner. In this book we see
this exemplified in one concrete case, in that of the relation between
the mythology, the magic, and the social institution of the Kula.</p>
<p>Thus we can define myth as a narrative of events which are to the
native supernatural, in this sense, that he knows well <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb304" href="#pb304" name="pb304">304</a>]</span>that
to-day they do not happen. At the same time he believes deeply that
they did happen then. The socially sanctioned narratives of these
events; the traces which they left on the surface of the earth; the
magic in which they left behind part of their supernatural powers, the
social institutions which are associated with the practice of this
magic&mdash;all this brings about the fact that a myth is for the
native a living actuality, though it has happened long ago and in an
order of things when people were endowed with supernatural powers.</p>
<p>I have said before that the natives do not possess any historical
perspective, that they do not range events&mdash;except of course,
those of the most recent decades&mdash;into any successive stages. They
also do not classify their myths into any divisions with regard to
their antiquity. But in looking at their myths, it becomes at once
obvious that they represent events, some of which must have happened
prior to others. For there is a group of stories describing the origin
of humanity, the emerging of the various social units from underground.
Another group of mythical tales gives accounts of how certain important
institutions were introduced and how certain customs crystallised.
Again, there are myths referring to small changes in culture, or to the
introduction of new details and minor customs. Broadly speaking, the
mythical folk-lore of the Trobrianders can be divided into three groups
referring to three different strata of events. In order to give a
general idea of Trobriand mythology, it will be good to give a short
characterisation of each of these groups.</p>
<p>1. <i>The Oldest Myths</i>, referring to the origin of human beings;
to the sociology of the sub-clans and villages; to the establishment of
permanent relations between this world and the next. These myths
describe events which took place just at the moment when the earth
began to be peopled from underneath. Humanity existed, somewhere
underground, since people emerged from there on the surface of Boyowa,
in full decoration, equipped with magic, belonging to social divisions,
and obeying definite laws and customs. But beyond this we know nothing
about what they did underground. There is, however, a series of myths,
of which one is attached to every one of the more important sub-clans,
about various ancestors coming out of the ground, and almost at once,
doing some important deed, which gives a definite character to the
sub-clan. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305" href="#pb305" name=
"pb305">305</a>]</span>Certain mythological versions about the nether
world belong also to this series.</p>
<p>2. <i>Kultur-myths</i>.&mdash;Here belong stories about ogres and
their conquerors; about human beings who established definite customs
and cultural features; about the origin of certain institutions. These
myths are different from the foregoing ones, in so far as they refer to
a time when humanity was already established on the surface of the
earth, and when all the social divisions had already assumed a definite
character. The main cycle of myths which belong here, are those of a
culture hero, Tudava, who slays an ogre and thus allows people to live
in Boyowa again, whence they all had fled in fear of being
eaten<span class="corr" id="xd26e10548" title="Not in source">.</span>
A story about the origins of cannibalism belongs here also, and about
the origin of garden making.</p>
<p>3. <i>Myths in which figure only ordinary human beings</i>, though
endowed with extraordinary magical powers. These myths are
distinguished from the foregoing ones, by the fact that no ogres or
non-human persons figure in them, and that they refer to the origin,
not of whole aspects of culture, such as cannibalism or garden-making,
but to definite institutions or definite forms of magic. Here comes the
myth about the origins of sorcery, the myth about the origins of love
magic, the myth of the flying canoe, and finally the several Kula
myths. The line of division between these three categories is, of
course, not a rigid one, and many a myth could be placed in two or even
three of these classes, according to its several features or episodes.
But each myth contains as a rule one main subject, and if we take only
this, there is hardly ever the slightest doubt as to where it should be
placed.</p>
<p>A point which might appear contradictory in superficial reading is
that before, we stressed the fact that the natives had no idea of
change, yet here we spoke of myths about &lsquo;origins&rsquo; of
institutions. It is important to realise that, though natives do speak
about times when humanity was not upon the earth, of times when there
were no gardens, etc., yet all these things arrive ready-made; they do
not change or evolve. The first people, who came from underground, came
up adorned with the same trinkets, carrying their lime-pot and chewing
their betel-nut. The event, the emergence from the earth was mythical,
that is, such as does not happen now; but the human beings and the
country which received them were such as exist to-day. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">III</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The myths of the Kula are scattered along a section of
the present Kula circuit. Beginning with a place in Eastern Woodlark
Island, the village of Wamwara, the mythological centres are spread
round almost in a semi-circle, right down to the island of Tewara,
Where we have left for the present our party from Sinaketa.</p>
<p>In Wamwara there lived an individual called Gere&rsquo;u, who,
according to one myth, was the originator of the Kula. In the island of
Digumenu, West of Woodlark Island, Tokosikuna, another hero of the
Kula, had his early home, though he finished his career in Gumasila, in
the Amphletts. Kitava, the westernmost of the Marshall Bennetts, is the
centre of canoe magic associated with the Kula. It is also the home of
Monikiniki, whose name figures in many formul&aelig; of the Kula magic,
though there is no explicit myth about him, except that he was the
first man to practice an important system of <i lang="kij">mwasila</i>
(Kula magic), probably the most widespread system of the present day.
Further West, in Wawela, we are at the other end of the
Kasabwaybwayreta myth, which starts in Tewara, and goes over to Wawela
in its narrative of events, to return to Tewara again. This
mythological narrative touches the island of Boyowa at its southernmost
point, the passage Giribwa, which divides it from Vakuta. Almost all
myths have one of their incidents laid in a small island between Vakuta
and the Amphletts, called Gabuwana. One of the myths leads us to the
Amphletts, that of Tokosikuna; another has its beginning and end in
Tewara. Such is the geography of the Kula myths on the big sector
between Murua and Dobu.</p>
<p>Although I do not know the other half through investigations made on
the spot, I have spoken with natives from those districts, and I think
that there are no myths localised anywhere on the sector Murua
(Woodlark Island), Tubetube, and Dobu. What I am quite certain of,
however, is that the whole of the Trobriands, except the two points
mentioned before, lie outside the mythological area of the Kula. No
Kula stories, associated with any village in the Northern half of
Boyowa exist, nor does any of the mythical heroes of the other stories
ever come to the Northern or Western provinces of the Trobriands. Such
extremely important centres as Sinaketa <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb307" href="#pb307" name="pb307">307</a>]</span>and Omarakana are
never mentioned. This would point, on the surface of it, to the fact
that in olden days, the island of Boyowa, except its Southern end and
the Eastern settlement of Wawela, either did not enter at all or did
not play an important part in the Kula.</p>
<p>I shall give a somewhat abbreviated account of the various stories,
and then adduce in extenso the one last mentioned, perhaps the most
noteworthy of all the Kula myths, that of Kasabwaybwayreta, as well as
the very important canoe myth, that of the flying <i lang=
"kij">waga</i> of Kudayuri.</p>
<p>The Muruan myth, which I obtained only in a very bald outline, is
localised in the village of Wamwara, at the Eastern end of the island.
A man called Gere&rsquo;u, of the Lukuba clan, knew very well the
<i lang="kij">mwasila</i> magic, and wherever he went, all the
valuables were given to him, so that all the others returned
empty-handed. He went to Gawa and Iwa, and as Soon as he appeared,
<i lang="kij">pu-pu</i> went the conch shells, and everybody gave him
the <i lang="kij">bagi</i> necklaces. He returned to his village, full
of glory and of Kula spoils. Then he went to Du&rsquo;a&rsquo;u, and
obtained again an enormous amount of arm-shells. He settled the
direction in which the Kula valuables have to move. <i lang=
"kij">Bagi</i> necklaces have &lsquo;to go,&rsquo; and the arm-shells
&lsquo;to come.&rsquo; As this was spoken on Boyowa, &lsquo;go&rsquo;
meant to travel from Boyowa to Woodlark, &lsquo;come&rsquo; to travel
from Gere&rsquo;u&rsquo;s village to Sinaketa. The culture hero
Gere&rsquo;u was finally killed, through envy of his success in the
Kula.</p>
<p>I obtained two versions about the mythological hero, Tokosikuna of
Digumenu. In the first of them, he is represented as a complete
cripple, without hands and feet, who has to be carried by his two
daughters into the canoe. They sail on a Kula expedition through Iwa,
Gawa, through the Straits of Giribwa to Gumasila. Then they put him on
a platform, where he takes a meal and goes to sleep. They leave him
there and go into a garden which they see on a hill above, in order to
gather some food. On coming back, they find him dead. On hearing their
wailing, an ogre comes out, marries one of them and adopts the other.
As he was very ugly, however, the girls killed him in an obscene
manner, and then settled in the island. This obviously mutilated and
superficial version does not give us many clues to the native ideas
about the Kula. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb308" href="#pb308"
name="pb308">308</a>]</span></p>
<p>The other version is much more interesting. Tokosikuna, according to
it, is also slightly crippled, lame, very ugly, and with a pitted skin;
so ugly indeed that he could not marry. Far North, in the mythical land
of Kokopawa, they play a flute so beautifully that the chief of
Digumenu, the village of Tokosikuna, hears it. He wishes to obtain the
flute. Many men set out, but all fail, and they have to return half
way, because it is so far. Tokosikuna goes, and, through a mixture of
cunning and daring, he succeeds in getting possession of the flute, and
in returning safely to Digumenu. There, through magic which one is led
to infer he has acquired on his journey, he changes his appearance,
becomes young, smooth-skinned and beautiful. The <i lang=
"kij">guya&rsquo;u</i> (chief) who is away in his garden, hears the
flute played in his village, and returning there, he sees Tokosikuna
sitting on a high platform, playing the flute and looking beautiful.
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;all my daughters, all my
granddaughters, my nieces and my sisters, you all marry Tokosikuna!
Your husbands, you leave behind! You marry Tokosikuna, for he has
brought the flute from the distant land!&rdquo; So Tokosikuna married
all the women.</p>
<p>The other men did not take it very well, of course. They decided to
get rid of Tokosikuna by stratagem. They said: &ldquo;The chief would
like to eat giant clam-shell, let us go and fish it.&rdquo; &ldquo;And
how shall I catch it?&rdquo; asks Tokosikuna. &ldquo;You put your head,
where the clam-shell gapes open.&rdquo; (This of course would mean
death, as the clam-shell would close, and, if a really big one, would
easily cut off his head). Tokosikuna, however, dived and with his two
hands, broke a clam-shell open, a deed of super-human strength. The
others were angry, and planned another form of revenge. They arranged a
shark-fishing, advising Tokosikuna to catch the fish with his hands.
But he simply strangled the big shark, and put it into the canoe. Then,
he tears asunder a boar&rsquo;s mouth, bringing them thus to despair.
Finally they decide to get rid of him at sea. They try to kill him
first by letting the heavy tree, felled for the <i lang="kij">waga</i>,
fall on him. But he supports it with his outstretched arms, and does no
harm to himself. At the time of lashing, his companions wrap some
<i lang="kij">wayaugo</i> (lashing creeper) into a soft pandanus leaf;
then they persuade him to use pandanus only for the lashing of his
canoe, which he does indeed, deceived by seeing them use what
apparently is the same. Then they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb309"
href="#pb309" name="pb309">309</a>]</span>sail, the other men in good,
sea-worthy canoes, he in an entirely unseaworthy one, lashed only with
the soft, brittle pandanus leaf.</p>
<p>And here begins the real Kula part of the myth. The expedition
arrives at Gawa, where Tokosikuna remains with his canoe on the beach,
while the other men go to the village to <i lang="kij">kula</i>. They
collect all the smaller armshells of the <i lang="kij">soulava</i>
type, but the big ones, the <i lang="kij">bagi</i>, remain in the
village, for the local men are unwilling to give them. Then Tokosikuna
starts for the village after all the others have returned. After a
short while, he arrives from the village, carrying all the <i lang=
"kij">bagido&rsquo;u bagidudu</i>, and <i lang=
"kij">bagiriku</i>&mdash;that is, all the most valuable types of
spondylus necklaces. The same happens in Iwa and Kitava. His companions
from the other canoes go first and succeed only in collecting the
inferior kinds of valuables. He afterwards enters the village, and
easily obtains the high grades of necklace, which had been refused to
the others. These become very angry; in Kitava, they inspect the
lashings of his canoe, and see that they are rotten. &ldquo;Oh well,
to-morrow, Vakuta! The day after, Gumasila,&mdash;he will drown in
Pilolu.&rdquo; In Vakuta the same happens as before, and the wrath of
his unsuccessful companions increases.</p>
<p>They sail and passing the sandbank of Gabula (this is the Trobriand
name for Gabuwana, as the Amphlettans pronounce it) Tokosikuna eases
his helm; then, as he tries to bring the canoe up to the wind again,
his lashings snap, and the canoe sinks. He swims in the waves, carrying
the basket-full of valuables in one arm. He calls out to the other
canoes: &ldquo;Come and take your <i lang="kij">bagi!</i> I shall get
into your <i lang="kij">waga!</i>&rdquo; &ldquo;You married all our
women,&rdquo; they answer, &ldquo;now, sharks will eat you! We shall go
to make Kula in Dobu!&rdquo; Tokosikuna, however, swims safely to the
point called Kamsareta, in the island of Domdom. From there he beholds
the rock of Selawaya standing out of the jungle on the eastern slope of
Gumasila. &ldquo;This is a big rock, I shall go and live there,&rdquo;
and turning towards the Digumenu canoes, he utters a curse:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will get nothing in Dobu but poor necklaces, <i lang=
"kij">soulava</i> of the type of <i lang="kij">tutumuyuwa</i> and
<i lang="kij">tutuyanabwa</i>. The big <i lang="kij">bagido&rsquo;u</i>
will stop with me.&rdquo; He remains in the Amphletts and does not
return to Digumenu. And here ends the myth.</p>
<p>I have given an extensive summary of this myth, including its first
part, which has nothing to do with the Kula, because <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb310" href="#pb310" name="pb310">310</a>]</span>it
gives a full character sketch of the hero as a daring sailor and
adventurer. It shows, how Tokosikuna, after his Northern trip, acquired
magic which allowed him to change his ugly and weak frame into a
powerful body with a beautiful appearance. The first part also contains
the reference to his great success with women, an association between
Kula magic and love magic, which as we shall see, is not without
importance. In this first part, that is, up to the moment when they
start on the Kula, Tokosikuna appears as a hero, endowed with
extraordinary powers, due to his knowledge of magic.</p>
<p>In this myth, as we see, no events are related through which the
natural appearance of the landscape is changed. Therefore this myth is
typical of what I have called the most recent stratum of mythology.
This is further confirmed by the circumstance that no allusion is made
in it to any origins, not even to the origins of the <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i> magic. For, as the myth is at present told and
commented upon, all the men who go on the Kula expedition with our
hero, know a system of Kula magic, the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> of
Monikiniki. Tokosikuna&rsquo;s superiority rests with his special
beauty magic; with his capacity to display enormous strength, and to
face with impunity great dangers; with his ability to escape from
drowning, finally, with his knowledge of the evil magic, <i lang=
"kij">bulubwalata</i>, with which he prevents his companions from doing
successful Kula. This last point was contained in a commentary upon
this myth, given to me by the man who narrated it. When I speak about
the Kula magic more explicitly further on, the reader will see that the
four points of superiority just mentioned correspond to the categories
into which we have to group the Kula magic, when it is classified
according to its leading ideas, according to the goal towards which it
aims.</p>
<p>One magic Tokosikuna does not know. We see from the myth that he is
ignorant of the nature of the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i>, the lashing
creeper. He is therefore obviously not a canoe-builder, nor acquainted
with canoe-building magic. This is the point on which his companions
are able to catch him.</p>
<p>Geographically, this myth links Digumenu with the Amphletts, as also
did the previous version of the Tokosikuna story. The hero, here as
there, settles finally in Gumasila, and the element of migration is
contained in both versions. Again, in the last story, Tokosikuna
decides to settle in the Amphletts, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb311" href="#pb311" name="pb311">311</a>]</span>on seeing the
Selawaya rock. If we remember the Gumasilan legend about the origin of
Kula magic, it also refers to the same rock. I did not obtain the name
of the individual who is believed to have lived on the Selawaya rock,
but it obviously is the same myth, only very mutilated in the Gumasilan
version.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Moving Westwards from Digumenu, to which the
Tokosikuna myth belongs, the next important centre of Kula magic is the
island of Kitava. With this place, the magical system of Monikiniki is
associated by tradition, though no special story is told about this
individual. A very important myth, on the other hand, localised in
Kitava, is the one which serves as foundation for canoe magic. I have
obtained three independent versions of this myth, and they agree
substantially. I shall adduce at length the story as it was told to me
by the best informant, and written down in Kiriwinian, and after that,
I shall show on what points the other versions vary. I shall not omit
from the full account certain tedious repetitions and obviously
inessential details, for they are indispensable for imparting to the
narrative the characteristic flavour of native folk-lore.</p>
<p>To understand the following account, it is necessary to realise that
Kitava is a raised coral island. Its inland part is elevated to a
height of about three hundred feet. Behind the flat beach, a steep
coral wall rises, and from its summit the land gently falls towards the
central declivity. It is in this central part that the villages are
situated, and it would be quite impossible to transport a canoe from
any village to the beach. Thus, in Kitava, unlike what happens with
some of the Lagoon villages of Boyowa, the canoes have to be always dug
out and lashed on the beach.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">The Myth of the Flying Canoe of Kudayuri.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Mokatuboda of the Lukuba clan and his younger
brother Toweyre&rsquo;i lived in the village of Kudayuri. With them
lived their three sisters Kayguremwo, Na&rsquo;ukuwakula and
Murumweyri&rsquo;a. They had all come out from underground in the spot
called Labikewo, in Kitava. These people were the <i lang=
"kij">u&rsquo;ula</i> (foundation, basis, here: first possessors) of
the <i lang="kij">ligogu</i> and <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> magic.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb312" href="#pb312" name=
"pb312">312</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;All the men of Kitava decided on a great Kula expedition to
the Koya. The men of Kumwageya, Kaybutu, Kabululo and Lalela made their
canoes. They scooped out the inside of the <i lang="kij">waga</i>, they
carved the <i lang="kij">tabuyo</i> and <i lang="kij">lagim</i>
(decorated prow boards), they made the <i lang="kij">budaka</i>
(lateral gunwale planks). They brought the component parts to the
beach, in order to make the <i lang="kij">yowaga</i> (to put and lash
them together).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kudayuri people made their canoe in the village.
Mokatuboda, the head man of the Kudayuri village, ordered them to do
so. They were angry: &lsquo;Very heavy canoe. Who will carry it to the
beach?&rsquo; He said: &lsquo;No, not so; it will be well. I shall just
lash my <i lang="kij">waga</i> in the village.&rsquo; He refused to
move the canoe; it remained in the village. The other people pieced
their canoe on the beach; he pieced it together in the village. They
lashed it with the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> creeper on the beach; he
lashed his in the village. They caulked their canoes on the sea-shore;
he caulked his in the village. They painted their canoes on the beach
with black; he blackened his in the village. They made the <i lang=
"kij">youlala</i> (painted red and white) on the beach; he made the
<i lang="kij">youlala</i> in the village. They sewed their sail on the
beach; he did it in the village. They rigged up the mast and rigging on
the beach; he in the village. After that, the men of Kitava made
<i lang="kij">tasasoria</i> (trial run) and <i lang=
"kij">kabigidoya</i> (visit of ceremonial presentation), but the
Kudayuri canoe did not make either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By and by, all the men of Kitava ordered their women to
prepare the food. The women one day put all the food, the <i lang=
"kij">gugu&rsquo;a</i> (personal belongings), the <i lang=
"kij">pari</i> (presents and trade goods) into the canoe. The people of
Kudayuri had all these things put into their canoe in the village. The
headman of the Kudayuri, Mokatuboda, asked all his younger brothers,
all the members of his crew, to bring some of their <i lang=
"kij">pari</i>, and he performed magic over it, and made a <i lang=
"kij">lilava</i> (magical bundle) of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people of other villages went to the beach; each canoe
was manned by its <i lang="kij">usagelu</i> (members of the crew). The
man of Kudayuri ordered his crew to man his canoe in the village. They
of the other villages stepped the mast on the shore; he stepped the
mast in the village. They prepared the rigging on the shore; he
prepared the rigging in the village. They hoisted the sail on the sea;
he spoke &lsquo;May our sail be hoisted,&rsquo; and his companions
hoisted the sail. He spoke: &lsquo;Sit in your places, every
man!&rsquo; He went into the house, he took his <i lang=
"kij">ligogu</i> (adze), <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb313" href=
"#pb313" name="pb313">313</a>]</span>he took some coco-nut oil, he took
a staff. He spoke magic over the adze, over the coco-nut oil. He came
out of the house, he approached the canoe. A small dog of his called
Tokulubweydoga jumped into the canoe.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e10761src" href="#xd26e10761" name="xd26e10761src">2</a> He spoke
to his crew: &lsquo;Pull up the sail higher.&rsquo; They pulled at the
halyard. He rubbed the staff with the coco-nut oil. He knocked the
canoe&rsquo;s skids with the staff. Then he struck with his ligogu the
<i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i> of his canoe and the <i lang=
"kij">dobwana</i> (that is, both ends of the canoe). He jumped into the
canoe, sat down, and the canoe flew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A rock stood before it. It pierced the rock in two, and flew
through it. He bent down, he looked; his companions (that is, the other
canoes of Kitava) sailed on the sea. He spoke to his younger brothers,
(that is to his relatives in the canoe): &lsquo;Bail out the water,
pour it out!&rsquo; Those who sailed on the earth thought it was rain,
this water which they poured out from above.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They (the other canoes) sailed to Giribwa, they saw a canoe
anchored there. They said: &lsquo;Is that the canoe from Dobu?&rsquo;
They thought so, they wanted to <i lang="kij">lebu</i> (take by force,
but not necessarily as a hostile act) the <i lang="kij">buna</i> (big
cowrie) shells of the Dobu people. Then they saw the dog walking on the
beach. They said: &lsquo;Wi-i-i! This is Tokulubweydoga, the dog of the
Lukuba! This canoe they lashed in the village, in the village of
Kudayuri. Which way did it come? It was anchored in the jungle!&rsquo;
They approached the people of Kudayuri, they spoke: &lsquo;Which way
did you come?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, I came together with you (the same
way).&rsquo; &lsquo;It rained. Did it rain over you?&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh
yes, it has rained over me.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day, they (the men of the other villages of Kitava),
sailed to Vakuta and went ashore. They made their Kula. The next day
they sailed, and he (Mokatuboda) remained in Vakuta. When they
disappeared on the sea, his canoe flew. He flew from Vakuta. When they
(the other crews) arrived in Gumasila, he was there on the promontory
of Lububuyama. They said: &lsquo;This canoe is like the canoe of our
companions,&rsquo; and the dog came out. &lsquo;This is the dog of the
Lukuba clan of Kudayuri.&rsquo; They asked him again which way he came;
he said he came the same way as they. They made the Kula in Gumasila.
He said: &lsquo;You sail first, I shall sail later on.&rsquo; They were
astonished: &lsquo;Which way does he sail?&rsquo; They slept in
Gumasila.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb314" href="#pb314"
name="pb314">314</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day they sailed to Tewara, they arrived at the beach of
Kadimwatu. They saw his canoe anchored there, the dog came out and ran
along the beach. They spoke to the Kudayuri men, &lsquo;How did you
come here?&rsquo; &lsquo;We came with you, the same way we came.&rsquo;
They made Kula in Tewara. Next day, they sailed to Bwayowa (village in
Dobu district). He flew, and anchored at the beach Sarubwoyna. They
arrived there, they saw: &lsquo;Oh, look at the canoe, are these
fishermen from Dobu?&rsquo; The dog came out. They recognised the dog.
They asked him (Mokatuboda) which way he came: &lsquo;I came with you,
I anchored here.&rsquo; They went to the village of Bwayowa, they made
Kula in the village, they loaded their canoes. They received presents
from the Dobu people at parting, and the Kitava men sailed on the
return journey. They sailed first, and he flew through the air.<a id=
"xd26e10792" name="xd26e10792"></a>&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the return journey, at every stage, they see him first, they ask
him which way he went, and he gives them some sort of answer as the
above ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Giribwa they sailed to Kitava; he remained in Giribwa;
he flew from Giribwa; he went to Kitava, to the beach. His <i lang=
"kij">gugu&rsquo;a</i> (personal belongings) were being carried to the
village when his companions came paddling along, and saw his canoe
anchored and the dog running on the beach. All the other men were very
angry, because his canoe flew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They remained in Kitava. Next year, they made their gardens,
all the men of Kitava. The sun was very strong, there was no rain at
all. The sun burned their gardens. This man (the head man of Kudayuri,
Mokatuboda) went into the garden. He remained there, he made a <i lang=
"kij">bulubwalata</i> (evil magic) of the rain. A small cloud came and
rained on his garden only, and their gardens the sun burned. They (the
other men of Kitava) went and saw their gardens. They arrived there,
they saw all was dead, already the sun had burned them. They went to
his garden and it was all wet: yams, <i lang="kij">taitu</i>, taro, all
was fine. They spoke: &lsquo;Let us kill him so that he might die. We
shall then speak magic over the clouds, and it will rain over our
gardens.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The real, keen magic, the Kudayuri man (i.e. Mokatuboda) did
not give to them; he gave them not the magic of the <i lang=
"kij">ligogu</i> (adze); he gave them not the magic of <i lang=
"kij">kunisalili</i> (rain magic); he gave them not the magic of the
<i lang="kij">wayugo</i> (lashing creeper), of the coco-nut oil and
staff. Toweyre&rsquo;i, his younger brother, thought that he
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb315" href="#pb315" name=
"pb315">315</a>]</span>had already received the magic, but he was
mistaken. His elder brother gave him only part of the magic, the real
one he kept back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They came (to Mokatuboda, the head man of Kudayuri), he sat
in his village. His brothers and maternal nephews sharpened the spear,
they hit him, he died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next year, they decided to make a big Kula expedition, to
Dobu. The old <i lang="kij">waga</i>, cut and lashed by Mokatuboda, was
no more good, the lashings had perished. Then Toweyre&rsquo;i, the
younger brother, cut a new one to replace the old. The people of
Kumwageya and Lalela (the other villages in Kitava) heard that
Toweyre&rsquo;i cuts his <i lang="kij">waga</i>, and they also cut
theirs. They pieced and lashed their canoes on the beach.
Toweyre&rsquo;i did it in the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the native narrative enumerates every detail of canoe making,
drawing the contrast between the proceedings on the beach of the other
Kitavans, and of Toweyre&rsquo;i building the canoe in the village of
Kudayuri. It is an exact repetition of what was said at the beginning,
when Mokatuboda was building his canoe, and I shall not adduce it here.
The narrative arrives at the critical moment when all the members of
the crew are seated in the canoe ready for the flight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toweyre&rsquo;i went into the house and made magic over the
adze and the coco-nut oil. He came out, smeared a staff with the oil,
knocked the skids of the canoe. He then did as his elder brother did.
He struck both ends of the canoe with the adze. He jumped into the
canoe and sat down; but the <i lang="kij">waga</i> did not fly.
Toweyre&rsquo;i went into the house and cried for his elder brother,
whom he had slain; he had killed him without knowing his magic. The
people of Kumwageya and Lalela went to Dobu and made their Kula. The
people of Kudayuri remained in the village.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three sisters were very angry with Toweyre&rsquo;i, for
he killed the elder brother and did not learn his magic. They
themselves had learnt the <i lang="kij">ligogu</i>, the <i lang=
"kij">wayugo</i> magic; they had it already in their <i lang=
"kij">lopoula</i> (belly). They could fly through the air, they were
<i lang="kij">yoyova</i>. In Kitava they lived on the top of
Botigale&rsquo;a hill. They said: &lsquo;Let us leave Kitava and fly
away.&rsquo; They flew through the air. One of them,
Na&rsquo;ukuwakula, flew to the West, pierced through the sea-passage
Dikuwa&rsquo;i (Somewhere in the Western Trobriands); she arrived at
Simsim (one of the Lousan&ccedil;ay). There she turned into a stone,
she stands in the sea.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316"
href="#pb316" name="pb316">316</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The two others flew first (due West) to the beach of
Yalumugwa (on the Eastern shore of Boyowa). There they tried to pierce
the coral rock named Yakayba&mdash;it was too hard. They went (further
South on the Eastern shore) through the sea-passage of Vilasasa and
tried to pierce the rock Kuyaluya&mdash;they couldn&rsquo;t. They went
(further South) and tried to pierce the rock of Kawakari&mdash;it was
too hard. They went (further South). They tried to pierce the rocks at
Giribwa. They succeeded. That is why there is now a sea passage at
Giribwa (the straits dividing the main island of Boyowa from the island
of Vakuta).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They flew (further South) towards Dobu. They came to the
island of Tewara. They came to the beach of Kadimwatu and pierced it.
This is where the straits of Kadimwatu are now between the islands of
Tewara and Uwama. They went to Dobu; they travelled further South, to
the promontory of Saramwa (near Dobu island). They spoke: &lsquo;Shall
we go round the point or pierce right through?&rsquo; They went round
the point. They met another obstacle and pierced it through, making the
Straits of Loma (at the Western end of Dawson Straits). They came back,
they returned and settled near Tewara. They turned into stones; they
stand in the sea. One of them cast her eyes on Dobu, this is
Murumweyri&rsquo;a; she eats men, and the Dobuans are cannibals. The
other one, Kayguremwo, does not eat men, and her face is turned towards
Boyowa. The people of Boyowa do not eat man.&rdquo;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This story is extremely clear in its general outline, and very
dramatic, and all its incidents and developments have a high degree of
consistency and psychological motivation. It is perhaps the most
telling of all myths from this part of the world which came under my
notice. It is also a good example of what has been said before in
<a href="#div12.2">Division II</a>. Namely that the identical
conditions, sociological and cultural, which obtain at the present
time, are also reflected in mythical narratives. The only exception to
this is the much higher efficiency of magic found in the world of myth.
The tale of Kudayuri, on the one hand, describes minutely the
sociological conditions of the heroes, their occupations and concerns,
and all these do not differ at all from the present ones. On the other
hand, it shows the hero endowed with a truly super-normal power through
his magic of canoe building and of rain making. Nor could it be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317" name=
"pb317">317</a>]</span>more convincingly stated than is done in this
narrative that the full knowledge of the right magic was solely
responsible for these supernatural powers.</p>
<p>In its enumeration of the various details of tribal life, this myth
is truly a fount of ethnographic information. Its statements, when made
complete and explicit by native comment, contain a good deal of what is
to be known about the sociology, technology and organisation of
canoe-making, sailing, and of the Kula. If followed up into detail, the
incidents of this narrative make us acquainted for instance, with the
division into clans; with the origin and local character of these
latter; with ownership of magic and its association with the totemic
group. In almost all mythological narratives of the Trobriands, the
clan, the sub-clan and the locality of the heroes are stated. In the
above version, we see that the heroes have emerged at a certain spot,
and that they themselves came from underground; that is, that they are
the first representatives of their totemic sub-clan on the surface of
the earth. In the two other versions, this last point was not
explicitly stated, though I think it is implied in the incidents of
this myth, for obviously the flying canoe is built for the first time,
as it is for the last. In other versions, I was told that the hole from
which this sub-clan emerged is also called Kudayuri, and that the name
of their magical system is Viluvayaba.</p>
<p>Passing to the following part of the tale, we find in it a
description of canoe-building, and this was given to me in the same
detailed manner in all three versions. Here again, if we would
substitute for the short sentences a fuller account of what happens,
such as could be elicited from any intelligent native informant; if for
each word describing the stages of canoe-building we insert a full
description of the processes for which these words stand&mdash;we would
have in this myth an almost complete, ethnographic account of
canoe-building. We would see the canoe pieced together, lashed,
caulked, painted, rigged out, provided with a sail till it lies ready
to be launched. Besides the successive enumeration of technical stages,
we have in this myth a clear picture of the r&ocirc;le played by the
headman, who is the nominal owner of the canoe, and who speaks of it as
his canoe and at the same time directs its building; overrides the
wishes of others, and is responsible for the magic. We have even the
mention of the <i lang="kij">tasasoria</i> and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb318" href="#pb318" name=
"pb318">318</a>]</span><i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i>, and several
allusions to the Kula expedition of which the canoe-building in this
myth is represented as a preliminary stage. The frequent, tedious
repetitions and enumerations of customary sequences of events,
interesting as data of folk-lore, are not less valuable as ethnographic
documents, and as illustrations of the natives&rsquo; attitude towards
custom. Incidentally, this feature of native mythology shows that the
task of serving as ethnographic informant is not so foreign and
difficult to a native as might at first appear. He is quite used to
recite one after the other the various stages of customary proceedings
in his own narratives, and he does it with an almost pedantic accuracy
and completeness, and it is an easy task for him to transfer these
qualities to the accounts, which he is called upon to make in the
service of ethnography.</p>
<p>The dramatic effect of the climax of the story, of the unexpected
flight of the canoe is clearly brought out in the narrative, and it was
given to me in all its three versions. In all three, the members of the
crew are made to pass through the numerous preparatory stages of
sailing. And the parallel drawn between the reasonable proceedings of
their fellows on the beach, and the absurd manner in which they are
made to get ready in the middle of the village, some few hundred feet
above the sea, makes the tension more palpable and the sudden
<i>denouement</i> more effective. In all accounts of this myth, the
magic is also performed just before the flight, and its performance is
explicitly mentioned and included as an important episode in the
story.</p>
<p>The incident of bailing some water out of a canoe which never
touched the sea, seems to show some inconsistency. If we remember,
however, that water is poured into a canoe, while it is built, in order
to prevent its drying and consequently its shrinking, cracking and
warping, the inconsistency and flaw in the narrative disappear. I may
add that the bailing and rain incident is contained in one of my three
versions only.</p>
<p>The episode of the dog is more significant and more important to the
natives, and is mentioned in all three versions. The dog is the animal
associated with the Lukuba clan; that is, the natives will say that the
dog is a Lukuba, as the pig is a Malasi, and the igwana a Lukulabuta.
In several stories about the origin and relative rank of the clans,
each of them is represented by its totemic animal. Thus the igwana is
the first to emerge from underground. Hence the Lukulabuta are the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb319" href="#pb319" name=
"pb319">319</a>]</span>oldest clan. The dog and the pig dispute with
one another the priority of rank, the dog basing his claims on his
earlier appearance on the earth, for he followed immediately the
igwana; the pig, asserting himself in virtue of not eating unclean
things. The pig won the day, and therefore the Malasi clan are
considered to be the clan of the highest rank, though this is really
reached only in one of its sub-clans, that of the Tabalu of Omarakana.
The incident of the <i lang="kij">lebu</i> (taking by force) of some
ornaments from the Dobuans refers to the custom of using friendly
violence in certain Kula transactions (see <a href="#div14.2">chapter
XIV, Division II</a>).</p>
<p>In the second part of the story, we find the hero endowed again with
magical powers far superior to those of the present-day wizards. They
can make rain, or stay the clouds, it is true, but he is able to create
a small cloud which pours copious rain over his own gardens, and leaves
the others to be shrivelled up by the sun. This part of the narrative
does not touch the canoe problem, and it is of interest to us only in
so far as it again shows what appears to the natives the real source of
their hero&rsquo;s supernatural powers.</p>
<p>The motives which lead to the killing of Mokatuboda are not stated
explicitly in the narrative. No myth as a rule enters very much into
the subjective side of its events. But, from the lengthy, indeed
wearisome repetition of how the other Kitava men constantly find the
Kudayuri canoe outrunning them, how they are astonished and angry, it
is clear that his success must have made many enemies to Mokatuboda.
What is not so easily explained, is the fact that he is killed, not by
the other Kitava men, but by his own kinsmen. One of the versions
mentions his brothers and his sister&rsquo;s sons as the slayers. One
of them states that the people of Kitava ask Toweyre&rsquo;i, the
younger brother, whether he has already acquired the flying magic and
the rain magic, and only after an affirmative is received, is
Mokatuboda killed by his younger brother, in connivance with the other
people. An interesting variant is added to this version, according to
which Toweyre&rsquo;i kills his elder brother in the garden. He then
comes back to the village and instructs and admonishes
Mokatuboda&rsquo;s children to take the body, to give it the mortuary
attentions, to prepare for the burial. Then he himself arranges the
<i lang="kij">sagali</i>, the big mortuary distribution of food. In
this we find an interesting document <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb320" href="#pb320" name="pb320">320</a>]</span>of native custom and
ideas. Toweyre&rsquo;i, in spite of having killed his brother, is still
the man who has to arrange the mortuary proceedings, act as master of
ceremonies, and pay for the functions performed in them by others. He
personally may neither touch the corpse, nor do any act of mourning or
burial; nevertheless he, as the nearest of kin of the dead man, is the
bereaved one, is the one from whom a limb has been severed, so to
speak. A man whose brother has died cannot mourn any more than he could
mourn for himself.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e10904src" href=
"#xd26e10904" name="xd26e10904src">3</a> To return to the motives of
killing, as this was done according to all accounts by
Mokatuboda&rsquo;s own kinsmen, with the approval of the other men,
envy, ambition, the desire to succeed the headman in his dignity, must
have been mixed with spite against him. In fact, we see that
Toweyre&rsquo;i proceeds confidently to perform the magic, and bursts
out into wailing only after he has discovered he has been duped.</p>
<p>Now we come to one of the most remarkable incidents of the whole
myth, that namely which brings into connection the <i lang=
"kij">yoyova</i>, or the flying witches, with the flying canoe, and
with such speed of a canoe, as is imparted to it by magic. In the
spells of swiftness there are frequent allusions to the <i lang=
"kij">yoyova</i> or <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>. This can be clearly
seen in the spell of the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i>, already adduced
(<a href="#div5.3">Chapter V, Division III</a>), and which is still to
be analysed linguistically (<a href="#div18.2">Chapter XVIII, Divisions
II</a> to IV). The <i lang="kij">kariyala</i> (magical portent, cf.
<a href="#div17.7">Chapter XVII, Division VII</a>) of the <i lang=
"kij">wayugo</i> spell consists in shooting stars, that is, when a
<i lang="kij">wayugo</i> rite is performed at night over the creeper
coils, there will be stars falling in the sky. And again, when a
magician, knowing this system of magic, dies, shooting stars will be
seen. Now, as we have seen (<a href="#div10.1">Chapter X, Division
I</a>), falling stars are <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> in their
flight.</p>
<p>In this story of the Kudayuri we see the mythological ground for
this association. The same magic which allowed the canoe to sail
through the air gives the three sisters of Kudayuri their power of
being <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, and of flying. In this myth they
are also endowed with the power of cleaving the rocks, a power which
they share with the canoe, which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb321"
href="#pb321" name="pb321">321</a>]</span>cleft a rock immediately
after leaving the village. The three sisters cleave rocks and pierce
the land in several places. My native commentators assured me that when
the canoe first visited Giribwa and Kadimwatu at the beginning of this
myth, the land was still joined at these places and there was a beach
at each of them. The <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> tried to pierce
Boyowa at several spots along the Eastern coast, but succeeded only at
Giribwa. The myth thus has the archaic stamp of referring to deep
changes in natural features. The two sisters, who fly to the South
return from the furthest point and settle near Tewara, in which there
is some analogy to several other myths in which heroes from the
Marshall Bennett Islands settle down somewhere between the Amphletts
and Dobu. One of them turns her eyes northwards towards the
non-cannibal people of Boyowa and she is said to be averse to
cannibalism. Probably this is a sort of mythological explanation of why
the Boyowan people do not eat men and the Dobuans do, an explanation to
which there is an analogy in another myth shortly to be adduced, that
of Atu&rsquo;a&rsquo;ine and Aturamo&rsquo;a, and a better one still in
a myth about the origins of cannibalism, which I cannot quote here.</p>
<p>In all these traditions, so far, the heroes belonged to the clan of
Lukuba. To it belong Gere&rsquo;u, Tokosikuna, the Kudayuri family and
their dog, and also the dog, Tokulubwaydoga of the myth told in
<a href="#div10.5">Chapter X, Division V</a>. I may add that, in some
legends told about the origin of humanity, this clan emerges first from
underground and in some it emerges second in time, but as the clan of
highest rank, though in this it has to yield afterwards to the Malasi.
The main Kultur-hero of Kiriwina, the ogre-slayer Tudava, belongs, also
to the clan of Lukuba. There is even a historic fact, which agrees with
this mythological primacy, and subsequent eclipse. The Lukuba were,
some six or seven generations ago, the leading clan in Vakuta, and then
they had to surrender the chieftainship of this place to the Malasi
clan, when the sub-clan of the Tabalu, the Malasi chiefs of the highest
rank in Kiriwina, migrated South, and settled down in Vakuta. In the
myths quoted here, the Lukuba are leading canoe-builders, sailors, and
adventurers, that is with one exception, that of Tokosikuna, who,
though excelling in all other respects, knows nothing of canoe
construction. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb322" href="#pb322" name=

<p class="first">Let us now proceed to the last named mythological
centre, and taking a very big step from the Marshall Bennetts, return
to Tewara, and to its myth of the origin of the Kula. I shall tell this
myth in a translation, closely following the original account, obtained
in Kiriwinian from an informant at Oburaku. I had an opportunity of
checking and amending his narrative, by the information obtained from a
native of Sanaro&rsquo;a in pidgin English.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">The Story of Kasabwaybwayreta and
Gumakarakedakeda</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Kasabwaybwayreta lived in Tewara. He heard the
renown of a <i lang="kij">soulava</i> (spondylus necklace) which was
lying (kept) in Wawela. Its name was Gumakarakedakeda. He said to his
children: &lsquo;Let us go to Wawela, make Kula to get this <i lang=
"kij">soulava</i>.&rsquo; He put into his canoe unripe coco-nut,
undeveloped betel-nut, green bananas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went to Wawela; they anchored in Wawela. His sons went
ashore, they went to obtain Gumakarakedakeda. He remained in the canoe.
His son made offering of food, they (the Wawela people) refused.
Kasabwaybwayreta spoke a charm over the betel-nut: it yellowed (became
ripe); he spoke the charm over the coco-nut: its soft kernel swelled;
he charmed the bananas they ripened. He took off his hair, his gray
hair; his wrinkled skin, it remained in the canoe. He rose, he went he
gave a <i lang="kij">pokala</i> offering of food, he received the
valuable necklace as Kula gift, for he was already a beautiful man. He
went, he put it down, he thrust it into his hair. He came to the canoe,
he took his covering (the sloughed skin); he donned the wrinkles, the
gray hairs, he remained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His sons arrived, they took their places in the canoe, they
sailed to Giribwa. They cooked their food. He called his grandson;
&lsquo;Oh, my grandson, come here, look for my lice.&rsquo; The
grandson came there, stepped near him. Kasabwaybwayreta spoke, telling
him: &lsquo;My grandson, catch my lice in the middle (of my
hair).&rsquo; His grandson parted his hair; he saw the valuable
necklace, Gumakarakedakeda remaining there in the hair of
Kasabwaybwayreta. &lsquo;Ee&#8202;&hellip;&rsquo; he spoke to his
father, telling him, &lsquo;My father, Kasabwaybwayreta already
obtained Gumakarakedakeda.&rsquo; &lsquo;O, no, he did not <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb323" href="#pb323" name=
"pb323">323</a>]</span>obtain it! I am a chief, I am beautiful, I have
not obtained that valuable. Indeed, would this wrinkled old man have
obtained the necklace? No, indeed!&rsquo; &lsquo;Truly, my father, he
has obtained it already. I have seen it; already it remains in his
hair!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the water-vessels are empty already; the son went into
the canoe, spilled the water so that it ran out, and only the empty
vessels (made of coco-nut shell) remained. Later on they sailed, they
went to an island, Gabula (Gabuwana in Amphlettan and in Dobuan). This
man, Kasabwaybwayreta wanted water, and spoke to his son. This man
picked up the water vessels&mdash;no, they were all empty. They went on
the beach of Gabula, the <i lang="kij">usagelu</i> (members of the
crew) dug out their water-holes (in the beach). This man remained in
the canoe and called out: &lsquo;O my grandson, bring me here my water,
go there and dip out my water!&rsquo; The grandson said: &lsquo;No,
come here and dip out (yourself)!&rsquo; Later on, they dipped out
water, they finished, and Kasabwaybwayreta came. They muddied the
water, it was muddy. He sat down, he waited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went, they sailed in the canoe. Kasabwaybwayreta called
out, &lsquo;O, my son, why do you cast me off?&rsquo; Spoke the son:
&lsquo;I think you have obtained Gumakarakedakeda!&rsquo; &lsquo;O, by
and by, my son, when we arrive in the village, I shall give it to
you!&rsquo; &lsquo;O, no!<span class="corr" id="xd26e10999" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span> <span class="corr" id="xd26e11002"
title="Not in source">&lsquo;</span>Well, you remain, I shall
go!<span class="corr" id="xd26e11005" title=
"Source: &rdquo;">&rsquo;</span> He takes a stone, a <i lang=
"kij">binabina</i> one, this man Kasabwaybwayreta, he throws so that he
might make a hole in the canoe, and the men might go into the sea. No!
they sped away, they went, this stone stands up, it has made an island
in the sea. They went, they anchored in Tewara. They (the villagers)
asked: &lsquo;And where is Kasabwaybwayreta?&rsquo; &lsquo;O, his son
got angry with him, already he had obtained
Gumakarakedakeda!<span class="corr" id="xd26e11011" title=
"Not in source">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, this man Kasabwaybwayreta remained in the island
Gabula. He saw Tokom&rsquo;mwawa (evening star) approach. He spoke:
&lsquo;My friend, come here, let me just enter into your canoe!&rsquo;
&lsquo;O no, I shall go to another place.&rsquo; There came Kaylateku
(Sirius). He asked him: &lsquo;Let me go with you.&rsquo; He refused.
There came Kayyousi (Southern Cross). Kasabwaybwayreta wanted to go
with him. He refused. There came Umnakayva&rsquo;u, (Alpha and Beta
Centauri). He wanted a place in his canoe. He refused. There came Kibi
(three stars widely distant, forming no constellation in our
sky-chart). He also refused to take Kasabwaybwayreta. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb324" href="#pb324" name=
"pb324">324</a>]</span>There came Uluwa (the Pleiades).
Kasabwaybwayreta asked him to take him. Uluwa said: &lsquo;You wait,
you look out, there will come Kaykiyadiga, he will take you.&rsquo;
There came Kaykiyadiga (the three central stars in Orion&rsquo;s belt).
Kasabwaybwayreta asked him: &lsquo;My friend, which way will you
go?&rsquo; &lsquo;I shall come down on top of Taryebutu mountain. I
shall go down, I shall go away.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh, my friend, come here,
let me just sit down (on you).&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh come,&mdash;see on one
side there is a <i lang="kij">va&rsquo;i</i> (stingaree) on the other
side, there is the <i lang="kij">lo&rsquo;u</i> (a fish with poisonous
spikes); you sit in the middle, it will be well! Where is your
village?&rsquo; &lsquo;My village is Tewara.&rsquo; &lsquo;What stands
in the site of your village?&rsquo; &lsquo;In the site of my village,
there stands a <i lang="kij">busa</i> tree!<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e11027" title="Not in source">&rsquo;</span>&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They went there. Already the village of Kasabwaybwayreta is
straight below them. He charmed this <i lang="kij">busa</i> tree, it
arose, it went straight up into the skies. Kasabwaybwayreta changed
place (from Orion&rsquo;s belt on to the tree), he sat on the <i lang=
"kij">busa</i> tree. He spoke: &lsquo;Oh, my friend, break asunder this
necklace. Part of it, I shall give you; part of it, I shall carry to
Tewara.&rsquo; He gave part of it to his companion. This <i lang=
"kij">busa</i> tree came down to the ground. He was angry because his
son left him behind. He went underground inside. He there remained for
a long time. The dogs came there, and they dug and dug. They dug him
out. He came out on top, he became a <i lang="kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i>
(evil spirit, see <a href="#div2.7">Chapter II, Division VII</a>.) He
hits human beings. That is why in Tewara the village is that of
sorcerers and witches, because of Kasabwaybwayreta.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

</blockquote>
<p>To make this somewhat obscure narrative clearer, a short commentary
is necessary. The first part tells of a Kula expedition in which the
hero, his son, his grandson, and some other members of the crew take
part. His son takes with him good, fresh food, to give as solicitory
offering and thus tempt his partners to present him with the famous
necklace. The son is a young man and also a chief of renown. The later
stages are clearer; by means of magic, the hero changes himself into a
young, attractive man, and makes his own unripe, bad fruit into
splendid gifts to be offered to his partner. He obtains the prize
without difficulty, and hides it in his hair. Then, in a moment of
weakness, and for motives which it is impossible to find out from
native commentators, he on purpose reveals the necklace to his
grandson. Most likely, the motive was <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb325" href="#pb325" name="pb325">325</a>]</span>vanity. His son, and
probably also the other companions, become very angry and set a trap
for him. They arrange things so that he has to go for his own water on
the beach of Gabula. When they have already got theirs and while he is
dipping it out, they sail away, leaving him marooned on the sand-bank.
Like Polyphemus after the escaping party of Odysseus, he throws a stone
at the treacherous canoe, but it misses its mark, and becomes an
outstanding rock in the sea.</p>
<p>The episode of his release by the stars is quite clear. Arrived at
the village, he makes a tree rise by his magic, and after he has given
the bigger part of his necklace to his rescuer, he descends, with the
smaller part. His going underground and subsequent turning into a
<i lang="kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i> shows how bitter he feels towards
humanity. As usual, the presence of such a powerful, evil personality
in the village, gives its stamp to the whole community, and this latter
produces sorcerers and witches. All these additions and comments I
obtained in cross-questioning my original informant.</p>
<p>The Dobuan informant from Sanaro&rsquo;a introduced one or two
variants into the second part of the narrative. According to him,
Kasabwaybwayreta marries while in the sky, and remains there long
enough to beget three male and two female children. After he has made
up his mind to descend to earth again, he Makes a hole in the heavens,
looks down and sees a betel-nut tree in his village. Then he speaks to
his child, &lsquo;When I go down, you pull at one end of the
necklace.&rsquo; He climbs down by means of the necklace on to the
betel palm and pulls at one end of Gumakarakedakeda. It breaks, a big
piece remains in the skies, the small one goes with him below. Arrived
in the village, he arranges a feast, and invites all the villagers to
it. He speaks some magic over the food and after they have eaten it,
the villagers are turned into birds. This last act is quite in harmony
with his profession of <i lang="kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i>, which he
assumed in the previous version of the myth. My Dobuan informant also
added, by way of commentary, that the companions of Kasabwaybwayreta
were angry with him, because he obtained the necklace in Boyowa, which
was not the right direction for a necklace to travel in the Kula. This,
however, is obviously a rationalisation of the events of the myth.</p>
<p>Comparing the previously related story of Tokosikuna with this one,
we see at once a clear resemblance between them <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name="pb326">326</a>]</span>in
several features. In both, the heroes start as old, decrepit, and very
ugly men. By their magical powers, they rejuvenate in the course of the
story, the one permanently, the other just sloughing off his skin for
the purpose of a Kula transaction. In both cases, the hero is
definitely superior in the Kula, and by this arouses the envy and
hatred of his companions. Again, in both stories, the companions decide
to punish the hero, and the island or sandbank of Gabuwana is the scene
of the punishment. In both, the hero finally settles in the South, only
in one case it is his original home, while in the other he has migrated
there from one of the Marshall Bennett Islands. An anomaly in the
Kasabwaybwayreta myth, namely, that he fetches his necklace from the
North, whereas the normal direction for necklaces to travel is from
South to North in this region, makes us suspect that perhaps this story
is a transformation of a legend about a man who made the Kula from the
North. Ill-treated by his companions, he settled in Tewara, and
becoming a local Kultur-hero, was afterwards described as belonging to
the place. However this might be, and the hypothetical interpretation
is mine, and not obtained from the natives, the two stories are so
similar that they must be regarded obviously as variants of the same
myth, and not as independent traditions.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So much about the ethnographic analysis of these
myths. Let us now return to the general, sociological considerations
with which we opened this digression into mythology. We are now better
able to realise to what extent and in what manner Kula myths influence
the native outlook.</p>
<p>The main social force governing all tribal life could be described
as the inertia of custom, the love of uniformity of behaviour. The
great moral philosopher was wrong when he formulated his <i>categorical
imperative</i>, which was to serve human beings as a fundamental
guiding principle of behaviour. In advising us to act so that our
behaviour might be taken as a norm of universal law, he reversed the
natural state of things. The real rule guiding human behaviour is this:
&ldquo;what everyone else does, what appears as norm of general
conduct, this is right, moral and proper. Let me look over the fence
and see what my neighbour does, and take it as a rule for my
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327" name=
"pb327">327</a>]</span>behaviour.&rdquo; So acts every
&lsquo;man-in-the-street&rsquo; in our own society, so has acted the
average member of any society through the past ages, and so acts the
present-day savage; and the lower his level of cultural development,
the greater stickler he will be for good manners, propriety and form,
and the more incomprehensive and odious to him will be the
non-conforming point of view. Systems of social philosophy have been
built to explain and interpret or misinterpret this general principle.
Tarde&rsquo;s &lsquo;Imitation,&rsquo; Giddings&rsquo;
&lsquo;Consciousness of Kind,&rsquo; Durkheim&rsquo;s &lsquo;Collective
Ideas,&rsquo; and many such conceptions as &lsquo;social
consciousness,&rsquo; &lsquo;the soul of a nation,&rsquo; &lsquo;group
mind&rsquo; or now-a-days prevalent and highly fashionable ideas about
&lsquo;suggestibility of the crowd,&rsquo; &lsquo;the instinct of
herd,&rsquo; etc., etc., try to cover this simple empirical truth. Most
of these systems, especially those evoking the Phantom of Collective
Soul are futile, to my mind, in so far as they try to explain in the
terms of a hypothesis that which is most fundamental in sociology, and
can therefore be reduced to nothing else, but must be simply recognised
and accepted as the basis of our science. To frame verbal definitions
and quibble over terms does not seem to bring us much more forward in a
new branch of learning, where a knowledge of facts is above all
needed.</p>
<p>Whatever might be the case with any theoretical interpretations of
this principle, in this place, we must simply emphasise that a strict
adherence to custom, to that which is done by everyone else, is the
main rule of conduct among our natives in the Trobriands. An important
corollary to this rule declares that the past is more important than
the present. What has been done by the father&mdash;or, as the
Trobriander would say, by the maternal uncle&mdash;is even more
important as norm of behaviour than what is done by the brother. It is
to the behaviour of the past generations that the Trobriander
instinctively looks for his guidance. Thus the mythical events which
relate what has been done, not by the immediate ancestors but by
mythical, illustrious forbears, must evidently carry an enormous social
weight. The stories of important past events are hallowed because they
belong to the great mythical generations and because they are generally
accepted as truth, for everybody knows and tells them. They bear the
sanction of righteousness and propriety in virtue of these two
qualities of preterity and universality. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb328" href="#pb328" name="pb328">328</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus, through the operation of what might be called the elementary
law of sociology, myth possesses the normative power of fixing custom,
of sanctioning modes of behaviour, of giving dignity and importance to
an institution. The Kula receives from these ancient stories its stamp
of extreme importance and value. The rules of commercial honour, of
generosity and punctiliousness in all its operations, acquire through
this their binding force. This is what we could call the normative
influence of myth on custom.</p>
<p>The Kula myth, however, exercises another kind of appeal. In the
Kula, we have a type of enterprise where the vast possibilities of
success are very much influenced by chance. A man, whether he be rich
or poor in partners, may, according to his luck, return with a
relatively big or a small haul from an expedition. Thus the imagination
of the adventurers, as in all forms of gambling, must be bent towards
lucky hits and turns of extraordinarily good chance. The Kula myths
feed this imagination on stories of extreme good luck, and at the same
time show that it lies in the hands of man to bring this luck on
himself, provided he acquires the necessary magical lore.</p>
<p>I have said before that the mythological events are distinct from
those happening nowadays, in so far as they are extraordinary and
super-normal. This adds both to their authoritative character and to
their desirability. It sets them before the native as a specially
valuable standard of conduct, and as an ideal towards which their
desires must go out.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="div12.7" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">VII</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But I also said before that, distinct as it is, the
mythical world is not separated by an <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e11092" title="Source: unbridgable">unbridgeable</span> gulf from
the present order of events. Indeed, though an ideal must be always
beyond what actually exists, yet it must appear just within reach of
realisation if it is to be effective at all. Now, after we have become
acquainted with their stories, we can see clearly what was meant when
it was said, that magic acts as a link between the mythical and the
actual realities. In the canoe myth, for instance, the flying, the
super-normal achievement of the Kudayuri canoe, is conceived only as
the highest degree of the virtue of speed, which is still being
imparted nowadays to canoes by magic. The magical heritage of the
Kudayuri <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb329" href="#pb329" name=
"pb329">329</a>]</span>clan is still there, making the canoes sail
fast. Had it been transmitted in its complete form, any present canoe,
like the mythical one, could be seen flying. In the Kula myths also,
magic is found to give super-normal powers of beauty, strength and
immunity from danger. The mythological events demonstrate the truth of
the claims of magic. Their validity is established by a sort of
retrospective, mythical empiry. But magic, as it is practised nowadays,
accomplishes the same effects, only in a smaller degree. Natives
believe deeply that the formul&aelig; and rites of <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i> magic make those who carry them out attractive,
irresistible and safe from dangers (compare <a href="#ch13">next
chapter</a>).</p>
<p>Another feature which brings the mythical events into direct
connection with the present state of affairs, is the sociology of
mythical personages. They all are associated with certain localities,
as are the present local groups. They belong to the same system of
totemic division into clans and sub-clans as obtains nowadays. Thus,
members of a sub-clan, or a local unit, can claim a mythical hero as
their direct ancestor, and members of a clan can boast of him as of a
clansman. Indeed, myths, like songs and fairy stories, are
&lsquo;owned&rsquo; by certain sub-clans. This does not mean that other
people would abstain from telling them, but members of the sub-clan are
supposed to possess the most intimate knowledge of the mythical events,
and to be an authority in interpreting them. And indeed, it is a rule
that a myth will be best known in its own locality, that is, known with
all the details and free from any adulterations or not quite genuine
additions and fusions.</p>
<p>This better knowledge can be easily understood, if we remember that
myth is very often connected with magic in the Trobriands, and that
this latter is a possession, kept by some members of the local group.
Now, to know the magic, and to understand it properly, it is necessary
to be well acquainted with the myth. This is the reason why the myth
must be better known in the local group with which it is connected. In
some cases, the local group has not only to practise the magic
associated with the myth, but it has to look after the observance of
certain rites, ceremonies and taboos connected with it. In this case,
the sociology of the mythical events is intimately bound up with the
social divisions as they exist now. But even in such myths as those of
the Kula, which have become the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330"
href="#pb330" name="pb330">330</a>]</span>property of all clans and
local groups within the district, the explicit statement of the
hero&rsquo;s clan, sub-clan and of his village gives the whole myth a
stamp of actuality and reality. Side by side with magic, the
sociological continuity bridges over the gap between the mythical and
the actual. And indeed the magical and the sociological bridges run
side by side.</p>
<p>I spoke above (beginning of <a href="#div12.2">Division II</a>) of
the enlivening influence of myth upon landscape. Here it must be noted
also that the mythically changed features of the landscape bear
testimony in the native&rsquo;s mind to the truth of the myth. The
mythical word receives its substance in rock and hill, in the changes
in land and sea. The pierced sea-passages, the cleft boulders, the
petrified human beings, all these bring the mythological world close to
the natives, make it tangible and permanent. On the other hand, the
story thus powerfully illustrated, re-acts on the landscape, fills it
with dramatic happenings, which, fixed there for ever, give it a
definite meaning. With this I shall close these general remarks on
mythology though with myth and mythical events we shall constantly meet
in further inquiries.</p>

<p class="first">As we return to our party, who, sailing past the
mythical centre of Tewara, make for the island of Sanaro&rsquo;a, the
first thing to be related about them, brings us straight to another
mythological story. As the natives enter the district of Siayawawa,
they pass a stone or rock, called Sinatemubadiye&rsquo;i. I have not
seen it, but the natives tell me it lies among the mangroves in a tidal
creek. Like the stone Gurewaya, mentioned before, this one also enjoys
certain privileges, and offerings are given to it.</p>
<p>The natives do not tarry in this unimportant district. Their final
goal is now in sight. Beyond the sea, which is here land-locked like a
lake, the hills of Dobu, topped by Koyava&rsquo;u loom before them. In
the distance to their right as they sail South, the broad Easterly
flank of Koyatabu runs down to the water, forming a deep valley; behind
them spreads the wide plain of Sanaro&rsquo;a, with a few volcanic
cones at its Northern end, and far to the left the mountains of
Normanby unfold in a long chain. They sail straight South, making for
the beach of Sarubwoyna, where they will have to pause for a ritual
halt in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>order to carry out the final preparations and
magic. They steer towards two black rocks, which mark the Northern end
of Sarubwoyna beach as they stand, one at the base, the other at the
end of a narrow, sandy spit. These are the two rocks
Atu&rsquo;a&rsquo;ine and Aturamo&rsquo;a, the most important of the
tabooed places, at which natives lay offerings when starting or
arriving on Kula expeditions. The rock among the mangroves of Siyawawa
is connected with these two by a mythical story. The three&mdash;two
men whom we see now before us in petrified form, and one
woman&mdash;came to this district from somewhere &lsquo;Omuyuwa,&rsquo;
that is, from Woodlark Island or the Marshall Bennetts. This is the
story:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Myth of Atu&rsquo;a&rsquo;ine, Aturamo&rsquo;a and
Sinatemubadiye&rsquo;i.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;They were two brothers and a sister. They came
first to the creek called Kadawaga in Siyawawa. The woman lost her
comb. She spoke to her brethren: &lsquo;My brothers, my comb fell
down.&rsquo; They answered her: &lsquo;Good, return, take your
comb.&rsquo; She found it and took it, and next day she said:
&lsquo;Well, I shall remain here already, as
Sinatemubadiye&rsquo;i.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brothers went on. When they arrived at the shore of the
main island, Atu&rsquo;a&rsquo;ine said: &lsquo;Aturamo&rsquo;a, how
shall we go? Shall we look towards the sea?&rsquo; Said
Aturamo&rsquo;a; &lsquo;O, no, let us look towards the jungle.&rsquo;
Aturamo&rsquo;a went ahead, deceiving his brother, for he was a
cannibal. He wanted to look towards the jungle, so that he might eat
men. Thus Aturamo&rsquo;a went ahead, and his eyes turned towards the
jungle. Atu&rsquo;a&rsquo;ine turned his eyes, looked over the sea, he
spoke: &lsquo;Why did you deceive me, Aturamo&rsquo;a? Whilst I am
looking towards the sea, you look towards the jungle.&rsquo;
Aturamo&rsquo;a later on returned and came towards the sea. He spoke,
&lsquo;Good, you Atu&rsquo;a&rsquo;ine, look towards the sea, I shall
look to the jungle!&rsquo; This man, who sits near the jungle, is a
cannibal, the one who sits near the sea is good.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This short version of the myth I obtained in Sinaketa. The story
shows us three people migrating for unknown reasons from the North-East
to this district. The sister, after having lost her comb, decides to
remain in Siyawawa, and turns into the rock Sinatemubadiye&rsquo;i. The
brothers go only a few miles further, to undergo the same
transformation at the Northern end of Sarubwoyna beach. There is the
characteristic distinction <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href=
"#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span>between the cannibal and the
non-cannibal. As the story was told to me in Boyowa, that is, in the
district where they were not man-eaters, the qualification of
&lsquo;good&rsquo; was given to the non-cannibal hero, who became the
rock further out to sea. The same distinction is to be found in the
previously quoted myth of the Kudayuri sisters who flew to Dobu, and it
is to be found also in a myth, told about the origins of cannibalism,
which I shall not quote here. The association between the jungle and
cannibalism on the one hand, and between the sea and abstention from
human flesh on the other, is the same as the one in the Kudayuri myth.
In that myth, the rock which looks towards the South is cannibal, while
the Northern one is not, and for the natives this is the reason why the
Dobuans do eat human flesh and the Boyowans do not. The designation of
one of these rocks as a man-eater (<i lang="kij">tokamlata&rsquo;u</i>)
has no further meaning, more especially it is not associated with the
belief that any special dangers surround the rock.</p>
<p>The importance of these two rocks, Atu&rsquo;a&rsquo;ine and
Aturamo&rsquo;a lies, however, not so much in the truncated myth as in
the ritual surrounding them. Thus, all three stones receive an
offering&mdash;<i lang="kij">pokala</i>&mdash;consisting of a bit of
coco-nut, a stale yam, a piece of sugar cane and banana. As the canoes
go past, the offerings are placed on the stone, or thrown towards it,
with the words:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Old man (or in the case of <span class="corr"
id="xd26e11152" title=
"Source: Sinatemubadiyei">Sinatemubadiye&rsquo;i</span>, &lsquo;old
woman&rsquo;)<a id="xd26e11155" name="xd26e11155"></a> here comes your
coco-nut, your sugar cane, your bananas, bring me good luck so that I
may go and make my Kula quickly in Tu&rsquo;utauna.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This offering is given by the Boyowan canoes on their way to Dobu,
and by the Dobuans as they start on the Kula Northwards, to Boyowa.
Besides the offerings, certain taboos and observances are kept at these
rocks. Thus, any people passing close to the rock would have to bathe
in the sea out of their canoes, and the children in the canoes would be
sprinkled with sea-water. This is done to prevent disease. A man who
would go for the first time to <i lang="kij">kula</i> in Dobu would not
be allowed to eat food in the vicinity of these rocks. A pig, or a
green coco-nut would not be placed on the soil in this neighbourhood,
but would have to be put on a mat. A novice in the Kula would have to
make a point of going and bathing at the foot of Atu&rsquo;a&rsquo;ine
and Aturamo&rsquo;a. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb333" href="#pb333"
name="pb333">333</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Dobuans <i lang="kij">pokala</i> some other stones, to which the
Boyowans do not give any offerings. The previously mentioned Gurewaya
rock receives its share from the Dobuans, who believe that if they
passed it close by without making a <i lang="kij">pokala</i>, they
would become covered with sores and die. Passing Gurewaya, they would
not stand up in their canoes, nor would they eat any food when camping
on a beach within sight of Gurewaya. If they did so, they would become
seasick, fall asleep, and their canoe would drift away into the
unknown. I do not know whether there is any myth in Dobu about the
Gurewaya stone. There is a belief that a big snake is coiled on the top
of this rock, which looks after the observance of the taboos, and in
case of breach of any of them would send down sickness on them. Some of
the taboos of Gurewaya are also kept by the Boyowans, but I do not
exactly know which.</p>
<p>I obtained from a Dobuan informant a series of names of other,
similar stones, lying to the East of Dobu, on the route between there
and <span class="corr" id="xd26e11174" title=
"Source: Tubtube">Tubetube</span>. Thus, somewhere in the district of
Du&rsquo;a&rsquo;u, there is a rock called Kokorakakedakeda. Besides
this, near a place called Makaydokodoko there is a stone, Tabudaya.
Further East, near Bunama, a small stone called Sinada enjoys some Kula
prestige. In a spot Sina&rsquo;ena, which I cannot place on the map,
there is a stone called Taryadabwoyro, with eye, nose, legs and
hind-quarters shaped like those of a pig. This stone is called
&lsquo;the mother of all the pigs,&rsquo; and the district of
Sina&rsquo;ena is renowned for the abundance of these animals
there.</p>
<p>The only mythical fragment about any of these stones which I
obtained is the one quoted above. Like the two Kula myths previously
adduced, it is a story of a migration from North to South. There is no
allusion to the Kula in the narrative, but as the stones are <i lang=
"kij">pokala&rsquo;d</i> in the Kula, there is evidently some
association between it and them. To understand this association better,
it must be realised that similar offerings are given in certain forms
of magic to ancestral spirits and to spirits of Kultur-heroes, who have
founded the institution in which the magic is practised. This suggests
the conclusion that Atu&rsquo;a&rsquo;ine and Aturamo&rsquo;a are
heroes of the Kula like Tokosikuna and Kasabwaybwayreta; and that their
story is another variant of the fundamental Kula myth. <span class=

expedition has been already reached. For before them, there stretch in
a wide expanse the N.W. shores of Dawson Straits, where on the wide
beach, there are scattered the villages of Bwayowa, Tu&rsquo;utauna and
Deyde&rsquo;i, at the foot of Koyava&rsquo;u. This latter, the Boyowans
call Koyaviguna&mdash;the final mountain. Immediately behind the two
rocks, there stretches the beach of Sarubwoyna, its clean, white sand
edging the shallow curve of a small bay. This is the place where the
crews, nearing their final destination, have to make a halt, to prepare
themselves magically for approaching their partners in Dobu. As, on
their start from Sinaketa, they stopped for some time on Muwa and there
performed the last act of their inaugurating rites and ceremonies, so
in the same manner this beach is the place where they once more muster
their forces after the journey has been accomplished.</p>

<p class="figureHead">The Beauty Magic of the Mwasila.</p>
<p>The whole fleet are preparing for the final approach; in each canoe
magic is spoken over cosmetics and every man combs his hair, anoints
his body, and paints his face. (See <a href="#div13.1">Div. I</a>.)</p>
</div>
<p>This is the place which was already mentioned in <a href=
"#ch2">Chapter II</a> when, in giving a description of the district, we
imagined ourselves passing near this beach and meeting there a large
fleet of canoes, whose crews were engaged in some mysterious
activities. I said there that up to a hundred canoes might have been
seen anchored near the beach, and indeed, on a big <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> expedition in olden days such a figure could easily
have been reached. For, on a rough estimate, Sinaketa could have
produced some twenty canoes; the Vakutans could have joined them with
about forty; the Amphlettans with another twenty; and twenty more would
have followed from Tewara, Siyawawa, and Sanaroa. Some of them would
indeed not have taken part in the Kula, but have followed only out of
sheer curiosity, just <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href=
"#pb335" name="pb335">335</a>]</span>as in the big <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> expedition, which I accompanied in 1918 from Dobu to
Sinaketa, the sixty Dobuan canoes were joined by some twelve canoes
from the Amphletts and about as many again from Vakuta.</p>
<p>The Sinaketans having arrived at this beach, now stop, moor the
canoes near the shore, adorn their persons, and perform a whole series
of magical rites. Within a short space of time they crowd in a great
number of short rites, accompanied by formul&aelig; as a rule not very
long. In fact, from the moment they have arrived at Sarubwoyna up to
their entry into the village, they do not cease doing one magical act
or another, and the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> never stop incessantly
muttering their spells. To the observer, a spectacle of feverish
activity unfolds itself, a spectacle which I witnessed in 1918 when I
assisted at an analogous performance of the Dobuan Kula fleet
approaching Sinaketa.</p>
<p>The fleet halts; the sails are furled, the masts dismounted, the
canoes moored (see <a href="#pl48">Plate XLVIII</a>). In each canoe,
the elder men begin to undo their baskets and take out their personal
belongings. The younger ones run ashore and gather copious supplies of
leaves which they bring back into the canoes. Then the older men again
murmur magical formul&aelig; over the leaves and over other substances.
In this, the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> is assisted by others. Then,
they all wash in sea-water, and rub themselves with the medicated
leaves. Coco-nuts are broken, scraped, medicated, and the skin is
rubbed with the mess, which greases it and gives it a shining surface.
A comb is chanted over, and the hair teased out with it (see <a href=
"#pl49">Plate XLIX</a>). Then, with crushed betel-nut mixed with lime,
they draw red ornamental designs on their faces, while others use the
<i lang="kij">sayyaku</i>, an aromatic resinous stuff, and draw similar
lines in black. The fine-smelling mint plant, which has been chanted
over at home before starting, is taken out of its little receptacle
where it was preserved in coco-nut oil. The herb is inserted into the
armlets, while the few drops of oil are smeared over the body, and over
the <i lang="kij">lilava</i>, the magical bundle of <i lang=
"kij">pari</i> (trade goods).</p>
<p>All the magic which is spoken over the native cosmetics is the
<i lang="kij">mwasila</i> (Kula magic) of beauty. The main aim of these
spells is the same one which we found so clearly expressed in myth; to
make the man beautiful, attractive, and irresistible <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336" name="pb336">336</a>]</span>to
his Kula partner. In the myths we saw how an old, ugly and ungainly man
becomes transformed by his magic into a radiant and charming youth. Now
this mythical episode is nothing else but an exaggerated version of
what happens every time, when the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> of beauty
is spoken on Sarubwoyna beach or on other similar points of approach.
As my informants over and over again told me, when explaining the
meaning of these rites:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Here we are ugly; we eat bad fish, bad food;
our faces remain ugly. We want to sail to Dobu; we keep taboos, we
don&rsquo;t eat bad food. We go to Sarubwoyna; we wash; we charm the
leaves of <i lang="kij">silasila</i>; we charm the coco-nut; we
<i lang="kij">putuma</i> (anoint ourselves); we make our red paint and
black paint; we put in our fine-smelling <i lang="kij">vana</i> (herb
ornament in armlets); we arrive in Dobu beautiful looking. Our partner
looks at us, sees our faces are beautiful; he throws the <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> at us.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The bad fish and bad food here mentioned are the articles which are
tabooed to those who know the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i>, and a man may
often unwittingly break such a taboo.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that a deep belief in the efficacy of such magic
might almost make it effective. Although actual beauty cannot be
imparted by spells, yet the feeling of being beautiful through magic
may give assurance, and influence people in their behaviour and
deportment, and as in the transaction it is the manner of the
soliciting party which matters, this magic, no doubt, achieves its aim
by <span class="corr" id="xd26e11295" title=
"Source: pyschological">psychological</span> means.</p>
<p>This branch of Kula magic has two counter-parts in the other magical
lore of the Trobrianders. One of them is the love magic, through which
people are rendered attractive and irresistible. Their belief in these
spells is such that a man would always attribute all his success in
love to their efficiency. Another type closely analogous to the beauty
magic of the Kula is the specific beauty magic practised before big
dances and festivities.</p>
<p>Let us now give one or two samples of the magic which is performed
on Sarubwoyna beach. The ritual in all of it is exceedingly simple. In
each case the formula is spoken over a certain substance, and then this
substance is applied to the body. The first rite to be performed is
that of ceremonial washing. The <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> brings his
mouth close to the big <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb337" href=
"#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>bundles of herbs, brought from the
shore and utters the formula called <i lang="kij">kaykakaya</i> (the
ablution formula) over them. After an ablution, these leaves are rubbed
over the skins of all those in the canoe who practise Kula. Then, in
the same succession as I mention them, the coco-nut, the comb, the
ordinary or the aromatic black paint or the betel-nut are charmed
over.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11311src" href="#xd26e11311" name=
"xd26e11311src">1</a> Only one, as a rule, of the paints is used. In
some cases the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> does the spell for everybody.
In other cases, a man who knows, say, the betel-nut or the comb spell,
will do it for himself or even for all others. In some cases again, out
of all these rites, only the <i lang="kij">kaykakaya</i> (ablution) and
one of the others will be performed.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Kaykakaya Spell</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;O <i lang="kij">katatuna</i> fish, O <i lang=
"kij">marabwaga</i> fish, <i lang="kij">yabwau</i> fish, <i lang=
"kij">reregu</i> fish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their red paint, with which they are painted; their red
paint, with which they are adorned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone they visit, together we visit; alone they visit,
together we visit a chief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They take me to their bosom; they hug me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The great woman befriends me, where the pots are boiling; the
good woman befriends me, on the sitting platform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two pigeons stand and turn round; two parrots fly
about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more it is my mother, my mother art thou, O woman of Dobu!
No more it is my father, my father art thou, O man of Dobu! No more it
is the high platform, the high platform are his arms; no more it is the
sitting platform, the sitting platform are his legs; no more it is my
lime spoon, my lime spoon is his tongue; no more it is my lime pot, my
lime pot is his gullet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This formula then passes into the same ending as the <i lang=
"kij">sulumwoya</i> spell, quoted previously, <a href="#ch7">Chapter
VII</a>, which runs: &ldquo;Recently deceased spirit of my maternal
uncle, etc.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>At the beginning of this spell, we find enumerated a series of fish
names. These fishes all have red markings on their bodies, and they are
tabooed to the people, who recite the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> magic
and do the Kula. If eaten, they would give a man an ugly appearance.
The above quoted saying of one of my informants: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>&ldquo;we eat bad fish, we are ugly,&rdquo;
refers to these fishes amongst others. In this formula, the invocation
is partly an appeal for assistance, and partly a sort of exorcism,
which is meant to undo the evil effects of breaking the taboo of eating
these fish. As this formula is associated with the ritual washing, the
whole <span class="corr" id="xd26e11375" title=
"Source: proceding">proceeding</span> possesses a sort of magical
consistency, which obtains within an exceedingly obscure and confused
concatenation of ideas: the redness of the fish, the red painting on
the human bodies for beauty, the invocation of the fishing magic, the
taboo on this fish. These ideas hang together somehow, but it would be
unwise and incorrect to attempt to put them into any logical order or
sequence.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e11378src" href="#xd26e11378" name=
"xd26e11378src">2</a> The sentence about &lsquo;visiting,&rsquo; in
this spell could not be made clear by any of my native informants. I
venture to suggest that the fish are invited to assist the adventurer
on his Kula visit, and to help him with their beauty.</p>
<p>The next few sentences refer to the reception he anticipates at
Dobu, in the forcible and exaggerated language of magic. The words
which have been here translated by &lsquo;take to his bosom,&rsquo;
&lsquo;hug,&rsquo; &lsquo;befriend,&rsquo; are the terms used to
describe the fondling and rocking and hugging of small children.
According to native custom, it would not be considered effeminate or
ridiculous for men to put their arms round each other and walk or sit
about thus. And it must be added, this is done without any homo-sexual
intention, at least of the grosser type. None the less, no such
fondling would really take place between the Dobuans and their Kula
partners. The mention of the &lsquo;great woman,&rsquo; the
&lsquo;great good woman&rsquo; refers to the wife and sister of the
partner, who, as we have said before, are considered to wield great
influence in the transactions.</p>
<p>The two pigeons and the two parrots express metaphorically the
friendship between the reciter of this magic and his partner. The long
list that follows expresses the exchange of his ordinary relations for
his Dobuan friends. An exaggerated description follows of the intimacy
between him and his partner, on whose arms and legs he will sit, and
from whose mouth he will partake of the betel chewing materials.</p>
<p>I shall give a sample of another of these spells, associated with
adornment and personal beauty. This is the spell spoken <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb339" href="#pb339" name="pb339">339</a>]</span>over
the betel-nut with which the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> and the members
of his canoe draw lines of vermilion red on their faces. Young
betel-nut, when crushed with lime in a small mortar, produces pigment
of wonderful brightness and intensity. Travellers in the countries of
the Indian Ocean and parts of the Pacific know it well, as the paint
that colours the lips and tongues of the natives.</p>

flashes.&rdquo; The new word, &lsquo;<i lang=
"kij">mitapwaypwa&rsquo;i</i>&rsquo; is a compound, expressing a
desire, a coveting, nascent in the eyes. The eyes are, according to
native psycho-physical theories, the seat of admiration, wish and
appetite in matters of sex, of greed for food, and for material
possessions. Here, this expression conveys that the Dobuan partner,
will, on beholding his visitor, desire to make Kula with him.</p>
<p>The spell ends: &ldquo;My head is made bright, my face flashes. I
have acquired a beautiful shape, like that of a chief; I have acquired
a shape that is good. I am the only one; my renown stands
alone.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>At the beginning we have again the mention of two fishes; evidently
the redness of the fish is the right redness for the Kula! I am unable
to explain the meaning of the second sentence, except that the petals
of the pandanus flower are slightly coloured at one end, and that they
are considered as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb340" href="#pb340"
name="pb340">340</a>]</span>one of the finest and most attractive
ornaments. The middle part and the end of this spell need no
commentary.</p>
<p>These two spells will be sufficient to indicate the general
character of the beauty magic of the Kula. One more spell must be
adduced here, that of the conch shell. This shell is as a rule
medicated at this stage of the Kula proceedings. Sometimes, however,
the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> would, before departure from home, utter
the formula into the opening of the conch shell, and close this up
carefully, so that the virtue might not evaporate. The conch shell is
made of a big specimen of the <i lang="la">Cassis cornuta</i> shell, at
the broad end of which the apex of the spiral windings is knocked out,
so as to form a mouth-piece. The spell is not uttered into the
mouthpiece, but into the broad opening between the lips, both orifices
being afterwards closed with coco-nut husk fibre until the shell has
actually to be blown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who comes ahead with the Kula? I&rdquo; (here the name of the

<p>After this exordium there comes a middle part, constructed on the
general principle of one word&rsquo;s being repeated with a series of
others. The keyword here is an expression denoting the state of
excitement which seizes a partner, and makes him give generous Kula
offerings. This word here is repeated first with a series of words,
describing the various personal belongings of the partner, his dog, his
belt; his tabooed coco-nut and betel-nut; and then, with a new series
of terms denoting the different classes of Kula valuables which are
expected to be given. This part could therefore be translated
thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A state of excitement seizes his dog, his belt, his <i lang=

etc.&rdquo; The spell ends in a typical manner: &ldquo;I shall <i lang=
"kij">kula</i>, I shall rob my Kula; I shall steal my Kula; I shall
pilfer my Kula. I shall <i lang="kij">kula</i> so as to make my canoe
sink; I shall <i lang="kij">kula</i> so as to make my outrigger go
under. My fame is like thunder, my steps are like
earthquake!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The first word of this spell, <i lang="kij">mwanita</i>, is the
native name for a long worm covered with rings of black armour. I was
told that it is mentioned here because of its similarity to the
spondylus shell necklaces, which also consist of many rings. I obtained
this formula in Sinaketa, hence this interpretation heeds only the
necklaces, though the simile might also obviously be extended to
armshells, for a number of armshells threaded on a string, as they can
be seen on <a href="#pl60">Plate LX</a>, presents also a likeness to
the <i lang="kij">mwanita</i> worm. It may be added here that Sinaketa
is one of these Kula communities in which the overseas expeditions are
done only in one direction, to the South, from where only the spondylus
necklaces are fetched. Its counterpart, Kiriwina, to the North, carries
on again only one-sided overseas Kula. The formul&aelig; which I
obtained in Kiriwina differ from those of Sinaketa in their main parts:
whenever there is a list of spondylus necklaces in a Sinaketan <i lang=
"kij">tapwana</i> (main part) a list of the several varieties of
armshells would be used in a Kiriwinian <i lang="kij">tapwana</i>. In
Kitava, where, as in several other Kula communities, the overseas
expeditions are carried out in both directions, the same formula would
be used by the same man with two different main parts, according as to
whether he was sailing East to fetch <i lang="kij">mwali</i>, or West
to fetch <i lang="kij">soulava</i>. No changes, however, would be made
in the beginning of a spell.</p>
<p>The sentence &lsquo;come here together&rsquo; refers to the
collected valuables. The play on &lsquo;there&rsquo; and
&lsquo;here,&rsquo; represented in the native language by the sounds
&lsquo;m&rsquo; and &lsquo;w,&rsquo; which are used as interchangeable
formatives, is very frequent in magic; (see <a href="#div18.12">Chapter
XVIII, Division XII</a>). The rainbow here invoked is a <i lang=
"kij">kariyala</i> (magical portent) of this formula. When the conch
shell is blown, and the fleet approaches the shore, a rainbow will
appear in the skies.</p>
<p>The rest of the exordium is taken up by the usual boasts and
exaggerations typical of magic. The middle part needs no <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>commentary. It is clear that the sound of the
conch shell is meant to arouse the partner to do his duty eagerly. The
magic spoken into the conch shell heightens and strengthens this
effect.</p>

<p class="first">After the beauty magic and the spell over the conch
shell are finished&mdash;and the whole performance does not take more
than half an hour or so&mdash;every man, in full festive array, takes
his place in his canoe. The sails have been folded and the masts
removed, and the final stage is done by paddling. The canoes close in,
not in any very regular formation, but keeping near to one another, the
canoe of the <i lang="kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i> as a rule moving in
the van. In each canoe, the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> sits at his
proper place in the middle of the canoe near the <i lang=
"kij">gebobo</i> (special erection made for cargo). One man sits in the
front, right against the prow-board, and another at the stern on the
platform. All the remaining members of the canoe wield the paddles,
while the small boy or the junior member of the crew, sits near the
front, ready to blow the conch shell. The oarsmen swing their
leaf-shaped paddles with long, energetic and swift strokes, letting the
water spray off them and the glistening blades flash in the
sunlight&mdash;a ceremonial stroke which they call <i lang=
"kij">kavikavila</i> (lightening).</p>
<p>As the canoes begin to move, the three men, so far idle, intone a
chant, reciting a special magical formula, each a different one. The
man in the front, holding his hand on the <i lang="kij">tabuyo</i>
(oval prow-board), recites a spell, called <i lang="kij">kayikuna
tabuyo</i> (the swaying of the prow-board). The <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> in the middle recites the powerful formula called
<i lang="kij">kavalikuliku</i> (the earthquake spell), a formula which
makes &ldquo;the mountain tremble and subside.&rdquo; The man at the
stern recites what is called <i lang="kij">kaytavilena moynawaga</i>, a
name which I cannot very well explain, which literally means,
&ldquo;the changing of the canoe entrance.&rdquo; Thus, laden with
magical force, which is poured forth irresistibly on to the mountain,
the canoes advance towards the goal of their enterprise. With the
voices of the reciters mingle the soft, penetrating sounds of the conch
shell, blending their various pitches into a weird, disturbing harmony.
Samples of the three spells must be given here. <span class=

<p>&ldquo;Fish-hawk, fall on thy prey, catch it.</p>
<p>My prow-board, O fish-hawk, fall on thy prey, catch it.</p>
<p>This key expression, the invocation of the fish-hawk, is repeated
with a string of words, denoting, first, the ornamental parts of the
canoe; afterwards, certain of its constructive parts; and finally, the
lime-pot, the lime stick<span class="corr" id="xd26e11571" title=

<p>&ldquo;I shall <i lang="kij">kula</i>, I shall rob my Kula,
etc.,&rdquo; as in the previously given formula of the conch shell.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The first two words of this spell are personal names of men, as the
initial syllable Mo- indicates, but no information about them was
available. The allusion to the fish-hawk in the main part suggests a
connection between the action of the rite, that is, the moving of the
<i lang="kij">tabuyo</i>, with this part of the spell, for the
ornamental prow-boards are called synonymously <i lang=
"kij">buribwari</i> (fish-hawk). On the other hand, the expression:
&ldquo;Fish-hawk, fall on thy prey,&rdquo; is no doubt also a magical
simile, expressing the idea: &ldquo;As a fish-hawk falls on his prey
and carries it off, so let this canoe fall on the Kula valuables and
carry them off.&rdquo; The association of this simile with the act of
shaking the <span class="corr" id="xd26e11594" title=
"Source: prowboards">prow-boards</span> is very suggestive. It may be
an attempt to assimilate the whole canoe and all its parts to a
fish-hawk falling on its prey, through the special mediation of the
ornamental <span class="corr" id="xd26e11597" title=
"Source: prowboard">prow-board</span>.</p>
<p>The spell recited by the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> in the middle of
the canoe runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p>&ldquo;The mountain is encountered in the Kula; we encounter the

<p>The expression, <i lang="kij">kubara, takuba, kubara</i>, which we
have here translated by &ldquo;the mountain is met in the Kula,
etc.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344" href="#pb344" name=
"pb344">344</a>]</span>is then repeated with a long string of words
denoting the various classes of valuables to be received in the Kula.
It ends with the conclusion already quoted: &ldquo;My renown is like
thunder, my steps are like earthquake.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The opening two sentences are clear; they contain a typical magical
exaggeration, and equally typical permutation of words. Then comes the
terrible verbal onslaught on &ldquo;the mountain,&rdquo; in which the
dreadful upheaval is carried on in words. &ldquo;The mountain&rdquo;
(<i lang="kij">koya</i>) stands here for the community of partners, for
the partner, for his mind. It was very difficult to translate the
expression <i lang="kij">kubara, takuba kubara</i>. It is evidently an
archaic word, and I have found it in several formul&aelig; of the
<i lang="kij">mwasila</i>. It seems to mean something like an encounter
between the approaching fleet and the <i lang="kij">koya</i>. The word
for sea battle is <i lang="kij">kubilia</i> in the Trobriand language,
and <i lang="kij">kubara</i> in that of the Amphletts and Dobu, and as
often the words of the partner&rsquo;s language are mixed up into these
formul&aelig;, this etymology and translation seem to be the correct
ones.</p>
<p>The third formula, that of the man in the stern, is as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Kaytavilena Mwoynawaga</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Crocodile, fall down, take thy man! push him

cargo is stowed away).&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crocodile, bring me the necklace, bring me the <i lang=
"kij">bagido&rsquo;u</i>, etc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The formula is ended by the usual phrase: &ldquo;I shall <i lang=
"kij">kula</i>, I shall rob my Kula, etc.,&rdquo; as in the two
previously quoted spells (Ta&rsquo;uyo and Kayikuna Tabuyo).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This formula is obviously a pendant to the first of these three
spells, and the crocodile is here invoked instead of the <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e11672" title="Source: fish hawk">fish-hawk</span>, with
the same significance. The rest of the spell is clear, the crocodile
being appealed to, to bring all the different classes of the spondylus
shell valuables.</p>
<p>It is interesting to reflect upon the psychological importance of
this magic. There is a deep belief in its efficiency, a belief
cherished not only by those who advance chanting it, but shared also by
the men awaiting the visitors on the shore. The Dobuans know that
powerful forces are at work upon them. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb345" href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>They must feel the
wave of magical influence slowly advancing, spreading over their
villages. They hear the appeal of the conch-shell, wafting the magic to
them in its irresistible note. They can guess the murmur of the many
voices accompanying it. They know what is expected from them, and they
rise to the occasion. On the part of the approaching party, this magic,
the chant of the many voices blended with the <i lang=
"kij">ta&rsquo;uyo</i> (conch shell), expresses their hopes and desires
and their rising excitement; their attempt to &ldquo;shake the
mountain,&rdquo; to stir it to its very foundations.</p>
<p>At the same time, a new emotion arises in their minds, that of awe
and apprehension; and another form of magic has to come to their
assistance at this juncture, to give expression to this fear and to
assuage it&mdash;the magic of safety. Spells of this magic have been
spoken previously, perhaps on the beach of Sarubwoyna alongside with
the rest, perhaps even earlier, at one of the intermediate stages of
the journey. But the rite will be performed at the moment of setting
foot ashore, and as this is also the psychological moment to which the
magic corresponds, it must be described here.</p>
<p>It seems absurd, from the rational point of view, that the natives,
who know that they are expected, indeed, who have been invited to come,
should yet feel uncertain about the good will of their partners, with
whom they have so often traded, whom they have received in visit, and
themselves visited and re-visited again and again. Coming on a
customary and peaceful errand, why should they have any apprehensions
of danger, and develop a special magical apparatus to meet the natives
of Dobu? This is a logical way of reasoning, but custom is not logical,
and the emotional attitude of man has a greater sway over custom than
has reason. The main attitude of a native to other, alien groups is
that of hostility and mistrust. The fact that to a native every
stranger is an enemy, is an ethnographic feature reported from all
parts of the world. The Trobriander is not an exception in this
respect, and beyond his own, narrow social horizon, a wall of
suspicion, misunderstanding and latent enmity divides him from even
near neighbours. The Kula breaks it through at definite geographical
points, and by means of special customary transactions. But, like
everything extraordinary and exceptional, this waiving of the general
taboo on strangers must be justified and bridged over by magic.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb346" href="#pb346" name=
"pb346">346</a>]</span></p>
<p>Indeed, the customary behaviour of the Dobuans and of the visitors
expresses this state of affairs with singular accuracy. It is the
customary rule that the Trobrianders should be received first with a
show of hostility and fierceness; treated almost as intruders. But this
attitude entirely subsides after the visitors have ritually spat over
the village on their arrival. The natives express their ideas on this
subject very characteristically:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Dobu man is not good as we are. He is
fierce, he is a man-eater! When we come to Dobu, we fear him, he might
kill us. But see! I spit the charmed ginger root, and their mind turns.
They lay down their spears, they receive us well.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div id="div13.3" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">III</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This show of hostility is fixed into a definite
ceremonial attitude when the Dobuan village, which consists of a
collection of hamlets, has been laid under a taboo. On the death of a
man of importance in any of the hamlets, the whole community undergoes
the so called <i lang="kij">gwara</i> taboo. The coco-nut and betel-nut
palms around and within the village are not allowed to be scaled, and
the fruit must not be touched by the Dobuans themselves, and still less
by strangers. This state of affairs lasts a varying length of time,
according to the importance of the dead man, and to other
circumstances. Only after the <i lang="kij">gwara</i> has run out its
course, and is ripe for expiring, do the Kiriwinians dare to come on a
visit to Dobu, having been advised beforehand of the circumstance. But
then, when they arrive, the Dobuans put up a show of real hostility,
for the visitors will have to break the taboo, they will have to scale
the palms, and take the forbidden fruit. This is in accordance with a
wide-spread Papuo-Melanesian type of custom of finishing tabooed
periods: in all cases, someone else, who is not under the taboo, has to
put an end to it, or to force the imposer of the taboo to break it. And
in all cases, there is some show of violence and struggle on the part
of the one who has to allow it to be broken. In this case, as the
Kiriwinian natives put it:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Supposing we do not perform the <i lang=
"kij">ka&rsquo;ubana&rsquo;i</i> (safety magic), we are afraid, when
there is a <i lang="kij">gwara</i> in Dobu<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e11723" title="Source: ,">.</span> The Dobuans put on war paint,
take spear in hand, and a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb347" href=
"#pb347" name="pb347">347</a>]</span><i lang="kij">puluta</i> (sword
club); they sit and look at us. We run into the village; we climb the
tree. He runs at us &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t climb,&rsquo; he cries. Then we
spit <i lang="kij">leyya</i> (ginger root) at him. He throws down his
spear, he goes back and smiles. The women take the spears away. We spit
all around the village. Then he is pleased. He speaks: &lsquo;You climb
your coco-nut, your betel-nut; cut your
bananas.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the taboo is broken, the <i lang="kij">gwara</i> is finished,
and the customary and histrionic moment of tension is over, which must
have been none the less a strain on the nerves of both parties.</p>
<p>This is the lengthy formula which a <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>
utters over several bits of ginger root, which are afterwards
distributed among his crew, each of whom carries a piece when getting
ashore.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">

<h2 class="main">Ka&rsquo;ubana&rsquo;i</h2>

<p>Thy war paint ebbs, it ebbs away, O man of Dobu!</p>

<p>Thy anger ebbs, it ebbs away, O man of Dobu!</p>
<p>Thy chasing away ebbs, it ebbs away, O man of Dobu!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long string of various expressings denoting hostile passions,
disinclination to make Kula, and all the paraphernalia of war are here
enumerated. Thus, such words as &ldquo;Kula refusal,&rdquo;
&ldquo;growling,&rdquo; &ldquo;sulking,&rdquo; &ldquo;dislike&rdquo;;
further: &ldquo;weapon,&rdquo; &ldquo;bamboo knife,&rdquo;
&ldquo;club-sword,&rdquo; &ldquo;large-barbed spear,&rdquo;
&ldquo;small-barbed spear,&rdquo; &ldquo;round club,&rdquo; &ldquo;war
blackening,&rdquo; &ldquo;red war paint,&rdquo; are uttered one after
the other. Moreover, all of them are repeated in their Dobuan
equivalents after the list has been exhausted in Kiriwinian. When this
series has been exhausted with reference to the man of Dobu, part of it
is repeated with the addition &ldquo;Woman of Dobu,&rdquo; the mention
of weapons, however, being omitted. But this does not end this
extremely long formula. After the protracted litany has been finished,
the reciter chants:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who emerges at the top of Kinana? I&rdquo; (here the name of
the reciter is mentioned) &ldquo;emerge on the top of
Kinana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the whole litany is again repeated, the key word, instead of,
&ldquo;it ebbs, it ebbs away&rdquo; being &ldquo;the dog sniffs.&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb348" href="#pb348" name=
"pb348">348</a>]</span></p>
<p>In connection with all the other words, this would run, more or
less, in a free translation:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy fury, O man of Dobu, is as when the dog sniffs,&rdquo;
or, more explicitly:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy fury, O man of Dobu, should abate as the fury of a dog
abates when it comes and sniffs at a new-comer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The simile of the dog must be very strongly ingrained in the magical
tradition, for in two more versions of this formula, obtained from
different informants, I received as key-words the expressions:
&ldquo;The dog plays about,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The dog is docile.&rdquo;
The final part of this formula is identical with that of the Kaykakaya
spell previously given in this chapter:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more it is my mother, my mother art thou, O woman of Dobu,
etc.,&rdquo; running into the ending &ldquo;Recently deceased,
etc.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In comment on this formula, there is first of all the name mentioned
in the first line, that of Nikiniki, or Monikiniki, as it is usually
pronounced, with the prefix of masculinity, <i lang="kij">mo-</i>. He
is described as &ldquo;A man, an ancient man; no myth about him; he
spoke the magic.&rdquo; Indeed, the main system of <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i> magic is named after him, but none of my informants
knew any legend about him.</p>
<p>The first key word of the middle part is quite clear. It describes
the ebbing away of the Dobuans&rsquo; passions and of their outward
trappings. It is noteworthy that the word for &lsquo;ebbing&rsquo; here
used, is in the Dobuan, and not in the Kiriwinian language. The
reference to the dog already explained may be still made clearer in
terms of native comment. One explanation is simple:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;They invoke the dog in the <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i>, because when master of dog comes, the dog stands up
and licks; in the same way, the inclinations of the Dobu people.&rdquo;
Another explanation is more sophisticated: &ldquo;The reason is that
dogs play about nose to nose. Supposing we mentioned the word, as it
was of old arranged, the valuables do the same. Supposing we had given
away armshells, the necklace will come, they will meet.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This means, by invoking the dog in this magic, according to old
magical tradition, we also influence the Kula gifts. This explanation
is undoubtedly far-fetched, and probably does not express the real
meaning of the spell. It would have no <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb349" href="#pb349" name="pb349">349</a>]</span>meaning in
association with the list of passions and weapons, but I have adduced
it as an example of native scholasticism.</p>
<p>The dog is also a taboo associated with this magic. When a man, who
practices the <i lang="kij">ka&rsquo;ubana&rsquo;i</i> eats and a dog
howls within his hearing, he has to leave his food, else his magic
would &lsquo;blunt.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Safe under the auspices of this magic, the Trobriand sailors land on
the beach of Tu&rsquo;utauna, where we shall follow them in the next

<p class="first">In the last chapter, we spoke about the institution of
<i lang="kij">gwara</i> (mortuary taboo) and of the threatening
reception accorded to the visiting party, at the time when it is laid
upon the village, and when it has to be lifted. When there is no
<i lang="kij">gwara</i>, and the arriving fleet are on an <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> expedition, there will be a big and ceremonial
welcome. The canoes, as they approach, will range themselves in a long
row facing the shore. The point selected will be the beach,
corresponding to a hamlet where the main partner of the <i lang=
"kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i> lives. The canoe of the <i lang=
"kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i>, of the master of the <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> expedition, will range itself at the end of the row.
The <i lang="kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i> will get up on to the platform
and harangue the natives assembled on the beach. He will try to appeal
to their ambition, so that they might give the visitors a large amount
of valuables and surpass all other occasions. After that, his partner
on the shore will blow a conch-shell, and, wading through the water,
advance towards the canoe, and offer the first gift of valuables to the
master of the expedition. This may be followed by another gift, again
given to the <i lang="kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i>. Other blasts then
follow, and men disengage themselves from the throng on the shore,
approaching the canoes with necklaces for their partners. A certain
order of seniority will be observed in this. The necklaces are always
carried ceremonially; as a rule they will be tied by both ends to a
stick, and carried hanging down, with the pendant at the bottom (see
<a href="#pl41">Plate LXI</a>). Sometimes, when a <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> (valuable) is carried to the canoes by a woman
(a headman&rsquo;s wife or sister) it will be put into a basket and
carried on her head. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb351" href="#pb351"

<p class="first">After this ceremonial reception, the fleet disperses.
As we remember from <a href="#ch2">Chapter II</a>, the villages in Dobu
are not built in compact blocks of houses, but scattered in hamlets,
each of about a dozen huts. The fleet now sails along the shore, every
canoe anchoring in front of the hamlet in which its <i lang=
"kij">toliwaga</i> has his main partner.</p>
<p>We have at last arrived at the point when the real Kula has begun.
So far, it was all preparations, and sailing with its concomitant
adventure, and a little bit of preliminary Kula in the Amphletts. It
was all full of excitement and emotion, pointing always towards the
final goal, the big Kula in Dobu. Now we have at last reached the
climax. The net result will be the <span class="corr" id="xd26e11874"
title="Source: acquision">acquisition</span> of a few dirty, greasy,
and insignificant looking native trinkets, each of them a string of
flat, partly discoloured, partly raspberry-pink or brick-red discs,
threaded one behind the other into a long, cylindrical roll. In the
eyes of the natives, however, this result receives its meaning from the
social forces of tradition and custom, which give the imprint of value
to these objects, and surround them with a halo of romance. It seems
fit here to make these few reflections upon the native psychology on
this point, and to attempt to grasp its real significance.</p>
<p>It may help us towards this understanding to reflect, that not far
from the scenes of the Kula, large numbers of white adventurers have
toiled and suffered, and many of them given their lives, in order to
acquire what to the natives would appear as insignificant and filthy as
their <i lang="kij">bagi</i> are to us&mdash;a few nuggets of gold.
Nearer, even, in the very Trobriand Lagoon, there are found valuable
pearls. In olden days, when the natives on opening a shell to eat it,
found a <i lang="kij">waytuna</i>, as they called it, a
&lsquo;seed&rsquo; of the pearl shell, they would throw it to their
children to play with. Now they see a number of white men straining all
their forces in competition to acquire as many of these worthless
things as they can. The parallel is very close. In both cases, the
conventionalised value attached to an object carries with it power,
renown, and the pleasure of increasing them both. In the case of the
white man, this is infinitely more complex and indirect, but not
essentially different from that of the natives. If we would imagine
that a great number of celebrated gems are let loose among us, and
travel from hand <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb352" href="#pb352"
name="pb352">352</a>]</span>to hand&mdash;that Koh-i-noor and Orloff
and other celebrated diamonds, emeralds and rubies&mdash;were on a
continuous round tour, and to be obtained through luck, daring and
enterprise, we would have a still closer analogy. Even though the
possession of them would be a short and temporary one, the renown of
having possessed them and the mania of &lsquo;collectioneering&rsquo;
would add its spur to the lust for wealth.</p>
<p>This general, human, psychological foundation of the Kula must be
kept constantly in mind. If we want, however, to understand its
specific forms, we have to look for the details and technicalities of
the transaction. A short outline of these has been given before in
<a href="#ch3">Chapter III</a>. Here, after we have acquired a better
knowledge of preliminaries, and a more thorough grasp of native
psychology and custom, we shall be more ready to enter into a detailed
description.</p>
<p>The main principle of the Kula exchange has been laid down in the
before-mentioned chapter; the Kula exchange has always to be a
<i>gift</i>, followed by a <i>counter-gift</i>; it can never be a
barter, a direct exchange with assessment of equivalents and with
haggling. There must be always in the Kula two transactions, distinct
in name, in nature and in time. The exchange is opened by an initial or
opening gift called <i lang="kij">vaga</i>, and closed by a final or
return present called <i lang="kij">yotile</i>. They are both
ceremonial gifts, they have to be accompanied by the blow of a conch
shell, and the present is given ostentatiously and in public. The
native term &ldquo;to throw&rdquo; a valuable describes well the nature
of the act. For, though the valuable has to be handed over by the
giver, the receiver hardly takes any notice of it, and seldom receives
it actually into his hands. The etiquette of the transaction requires
that the gift should be given in an off-hand, abrupt, almost angry
manner, and received with equivalent <span class="corr" id="xd26e11906"
title="Source: nochalance">nonchalance</span> and disdain. A slight
modification in this is introduced when, as it happens sometimes, in
the Trobriands, and in the Trobriands only, the <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> is given by a chief to a commoner, in which
case the commoner would take it into his hand, and show some
appreciation of it. In all other cases, the valuable would be placed
within the reach of the receiver, and an insignificant member of his
following would pick it up.</p>
<p>It is not very easy to unravel the various motives which combine to
make up this customary behaviour on receiving and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb353" href="#pb353" name=
"pb353">353</a>]</span>giving a gift. The part played by the receiver
is perhaps not so difficult to interpret. Right through their
ceremonial and commercial give and take, there runs the crude and
fundamental human dissatisfaction with the value received. A native
will always, when speaking about a transaction, insist on the magnitude
and value of the gift he gave, and minimise those of the equivalent
accepted. Side by side with this, there is the essential native
reluctance to appear in want of anything, a reluctance which is most
pronounced in the case of food, as we have said before (<a href=
"#div6.4">Chapter VI, Division IV</a>). Both these motives combine to
produce the, after all, very human and understandable attitude of
disdain at the reception of a gift. In the case of the donor, the
histrionic anger with which he gives an object might be, in the first
place, a direct expression of the natural human dislike of parting with
a possession. Added to this, there is the attempt to enhance the
apparent value of the gift by showing what a wrench it is to give it
away. This is the interpretation of the etiquette in giving and taking
at which I have arrived after many observations of native behaviour,
and through many conversations and casual remarks of the natives.</p>
<p>The two gifts of the Kula are also distinct in time. It is quite
obvious this must be so in the case of an overseas expedition of an
<i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> type, on which no valuables whatever are
taken with them by the visiting party, and so, any valuable received on
such an occasion, whether as <i lang="kij">vaga</i> or <i lang=
"kij">yotile</i>, cannot therefore be exchanged at the same time. But
even when the exchange takes place in the same village during an inland
Kula, there must be an interval between the two gifts, of a few minutes
at least.</p>
<p>There are also deep differences in the nature of the two gifts. The
<i lang="kij">vaga</i>, as the opening gift of the exchange, has to be
given spontaneously, that is, there is no enforcement of any duty in
giving it. There are means of soliciting it, (<i lang=
"kij">wawoyla</i>), but no pressure can be employed. The <i lang=
"kij">yotile</i>, however, that is, the valuable which is given in
return for the valuable previously received, is given under pressure of
a certain obligation. If I have given a <i lang="kij">vaga</i> (opening
gift of valuable) to a partner of mine, let us say a year ago, and now,
when on a visit, I find that he has an equivalent <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, I shall consider it his duty to give it to me.
If he does not do so, I am angry with him, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb354" href="#pb354" name="pb354">354</a>]</span>and
justified in being so. Not only that, if I can by any chance lay my
hand on his <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> and carry if off by force
(<i lang="kij">lebu</i>), I am entitled by custom to do this, although
my partner in that case may become very irate. The quarrel over that
would again be half histrionic, half real.</p>
<p>Another difference between a <i lang="kij">vaga</i> and a <i lang=
"kij">yotile</i> occurs in overseas expeditions which are not <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i>. On such expeditions, valuables sometimes are
carried, but only such as are due already for a past <i lang=
"kij">vaga</i>, and are to be given as <i lang="kij">yotile</i>.
Opening gifts, <i lang="kij">vaga</i>, are never taken overseas.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the <i lang="kij">vaga</i>, entails more wooing
or soliciting than the <i lang="kij">yotile</i>. This process, called
by the natives <i lang="kij">wawoyla</i>, consists, among others of a
series of solicitary gifts. One type of such gifts is called <i lang=
"kij">pokala</i>, and consists of food.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e11992src" href="#xd26e11992" name="xd26e11992src">1</a> In the
myth of Kasabwaybwayreta, narrated in <a href="#ch12">Chapter XII</a>,
this type of gift was mentioned. As a rule, a considerable amount of
food is taken on an expedition, and when a good valuable is known to be
in the possession of a man, some of this food will be presented to him,
with the words: &ldquo;I <i lang="kij">pokala</i> your valuable; give
it to me.&rdquo; If the owner is not inclined to part with his
Valuable, he will not accept the <i lang="kij">pokala</i>. If accepted,
it is an intimation that the <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> will
sooner or later be given to the man who offers the <i lang=
"kij">pokala</i>. The owner, however, may not be prepared to part with
it at once, and may wish to receive more solicitary gifts.</p>
<p>Another type of such a gift is called <i lang="kij">kaributu</i>,
and consists of a valuable which, as a rule, is not one of those which
are regularly <i lang="kij">kulaed</i>. Thus, a small polished axe
blade, or a valuable belt is given with the words: &ldquo;I <i lang=
"kij">kaributu</i> your necklace (or armshells); I shall take it and
carry it off.&rdquo; This gift again may only be accepted if there is
an intention to satisfy the giver with the desired <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>. A very famous and great valuable will often be
solicited by gift of <i lang="kij">pokala</i> and of <i lang=
"kij">kaributu</i>, one following the other. If, after one or two of
such solicitory gifts, the big <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> is
finally given, the satisfied receiver will often give some more food to
his partner, which gift is called <i lang="kij">kwaypolu</i>.</p>
<p>The food gifts would be returned on a similar occasion if it arises.
But there would be no strict equivalence in the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355" name=
"pb355">355</a>]</span>matter of food. The <i lang="kij">kaributu</i>
gift of a valuable, however, would always have to be returned later on,
in an equivalent form. It may be added that the <i lang=
"kij">pokala</i> offerings of food would be most often given from a
district, where food is more abundant than in the district to which it
is carried. Thus, the Sinaketans would bring <i lang="kij">pokala</i>
to the Amphletts, but they would seldom or never <i lang=
"kij">pokala</i> the Dobuans, who are very rich in food. Again, within
the Trobriands, a <i lang="kij">pokala</i> would be offered from the
Northern agricultural district of Kiriwina to men of Sinaketa, but not
inversely.</p>
<p>Another peculiar type of gift connected with the Kula is called
<i lang="kij">korotomna</i>. After a Sinaketan has given a necklace to
a man of Kiriwina, and this latter receives a minor valuable from his
partner further East, this minor valuable will be given to the
Sinaketan as the <i lang="kij">korotomna</i> of his necklace. This gift
usually consists of a lime spatula of whalebone ornamented with
spondylus discs, and it has to be repaid.</p>
<p>It must be noted that all these expressions are given in the
language of the Trobriands, and they refer to the gifts exchanged
between the Northern and Southern Trobriands on the one hand, and these
latter and the Amphletts on the other. In an overseas expedition from
Sinaketa to Dobu, the solicitary gifts would be rather given wholesale,
as the visitors&rsquo; gifts of <i lang="kij">pari</i>, and the subtle
distinctions in name and in technicality would not be observed. That
this must be so becomes clear, if we realise that, whereas, between the
Northern and Southern Trobriands the news about an exceptionally good
valuable spreads easily and quickly, this is not the case between Dobu
and Boyowa. Going over to Dobu, therefore, a man has to make up his
mind, whether he will give any solicitory presents to his partner, what
and how much he will give him, without knowing whether he has any
specially fine valuables to expect from him or not. If, however, there
was any exceptionally valuable gift in the visitors&rsquo; <i lang=
"kij">pari</i>, it will have to be returned later on by the
Dobuans.</p>
<p>Another important type of gift essential to the Kula is that of the
intermediary gifts, called <i lang="kij">basi</i>. Let us imagine that
a Sinaketan man has given a very fine pair of armshells to his Dobuan
partner at their last meeting in Sinaketa. Now, arriving in Dobu, he
finds that his partner has not got any necklace equivalent in value to
the armshells given. He none <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356" href=
"#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span>the less will expect his partner
to give him meanwhile a necklace, even though it be of inferior value.
Such a gift is a <i lang="kij">basi</i>, that is, not a return of the
highly valuable <i lang="kij">vaga</i>, but a gift given to fill in the
gap. This <i lang="kij">basi</i> will have to be repaid by a small
equivalent pair of armshells at a later date. And the Dobuan on his
side has still to repay the big armshells he received, and for which he
has as yet got no equivalent in his possession. As soon as this is
obtained, it will be given, and will close the transaction as a
clinching gift, or <i lang="kij">kudu</i>. Both these names imply
figures of speech. <i lang="kij">Kudu</i> means &lsquo;tooth,&rsquo;
and is a good name for a gift which clinches or bites. <i lang=
"kij">Basi</i> means to pierce, or to stab, and this is the literal
translation of a native comment on this name:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;We say <i lang="kij">basi</i>, for it does not
truly bite, like a <i lang="kij">kudu</i> (tooth); it just <i lang=
"kij">basi</i> (pierces) the surface; makes it lighter.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The equivalence of the two gifts, <i lang="kij">vaga</i> and
<i lang="kij">yotile</i>, is expressed by the word <i lang=
"kij">kudu</i> (tooth) and <i lang="kij">bigeda</i> (it will bite).
Another figure of speech describing the equivalence is contained in the
word <i lang="kij">va&rsquo;i</i>, to marry. When two of the opposite
valuables meet in the Kula and are exchanged, it is said that these two
have married. The armshells are conceived as a female principle, and
the necklaces as the male. An interesting comment on these ideas was
given to me by one of the informants. As mentioned above, a gift of
food is never given from Sinaketa to Kiriwina, obviously because it
would be a case of bringing coals to Newcastle. When I asked why this
is so, I received the answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;We do not now <i lang="kij">kwaypolu</i> or
<i lang="kij">pokala</i> the <i lang="kij">mwali</i>, for they are
women, and there is no reason to <i lang="kij">kwaypolu</i> or <i lang=
"kij">pokala</i> them.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>There is little logic in this comment, but it evidently includes
some idea about the smaller value of the female principle. Or else
perhaps it refers to the fundamental idea of the married status, namely
that it is for the woman&rsquo;s family to provide the man with
food.</p>
<p>The idea of equivalence in the Kula transaction is very strong and
definite, and when the receiver is not satisfied with the <i lang=
"kij">yotile</i> (return gift) he will violently complain that it is
not a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb357" href="#pb357" name=
"pb357">357</a>]</span>proper &lsquo;tooth&rsquo; (<i lang=
"kij">kudu</i>) for his opening gift, that it is not a real
&lsquo;marriage,&rsquo; that it is not properly
&lsquo;bitten.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These terms, given in the Kiriwinian language, cover about half of
the Kula ring from Woodlark Island and even further East, from Nada
(Loughlan Islands) as far as the Southern Trobriands. In the language
of Dobu, the same word is used for <i lang="kij">vaga</i> and <i lang=
"kij">basi</i>, while <i lang="kij">yotile</i> is pronounced <i lang=
"kij">yotura</i>, and <i lang="kij">kudu</i> is <i lang="kij">udu</i>.
The same terms are used in the Amphletts.</p>
<p>So much about the actual regulations of the Kula transactions. With
regard to the further general rules, the definition of Kula partnership
and sociology has been discussed in detail in <a href="#ch11">Chapter
XI</a>. As to the rule that the valuables have always to travel and
never to stop, nothing has to be added to what has been said about this
in <a href="#ch3">Chapter III</a>, for there are no exceptions to this
rule. A few more words must be said on the subject of the valuables
used in the Kula. I said in <a href="#ch3">Chapter III</a>, stating the
case briefly, that in one direction travel the armshells, whilst in the
opposite, following the hands of the clock, travel the necklaces. It
must now be added that the <i lang=
"kij">mwali</i>&mdash;armshells&mdash;are accompanied by another
article, the <i lang="kij">doga</i>, or circular boar&rsquo;s tusks. In
olden days, the <i lang="kij">doga</i> were almost as important as the
<i lang="kij">mwali</i> in the stream of the Kula. Nowadays, hardly any
at all are to be met as Kula articles. It is not easy to explain the
reason for this change. In an institution having the importance and
traditional tenacity which we find in the Kula, there can be no
question of the interference of fashion to bring about changes. The
only reason which I can suggest is that nowadays, with immensely
increased intertribal intercourse, there is a great drainage on all
Kula valuables by other districts lying outside the Kula. Now, on the
one hand the <i lang="kij">doga</i> are extremely valued on the
main-land of New Guinea, much more, I assume, than they are within the
Kula district. The drainage therefore would affect the <i lang=
"kij">doga</i> much more strongly than any other articles, one of
which, the spondylus necklaces, are actually imported into the Kula
region from without, and even manufactured by white men in considerable
quantities for native consumption. The armshells are produced within
the district in sufficient numbers to replace any leakage, but <i lang=
"kij">doga</i> are extremely difficult to reproduce, as they are
connected with a rare freak of nature&mdash;a boar with a circular
tusk. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb358" href="#pb358" name=
"pb358">358</a>]</span></p>
<p>One more article which travels in the same direction as the <i lang=
"kij">mwali</i>, consists of the <i lang="kij">bosu</i>, the big lime
spatul&aelig; made of whale-bone and decorated with spondylus shells.
They are not strictly speaking Kula articles, but play a part as the
<i lang="kij">korotomna</i> gifts mentioned above and nowadays are
hardly to be met with. With the necklaces, there travel only as an
unimportant subsidiary Kula article, belts made of the same red
spondylus shell. They would be given as return presents for small
armshells, as <i lang="kij">basi</i>, etc.</p>
<p>There is one important exception in the respective movements of
necklace and armshell. A certain type of spondylus shell strings, much
bigger and coarser than the strings which are used in the Kula, are
produced in Sinaketa, as we saw in the <a href="#ch13">last
Chapter</a>. These strings, called <i lang="kij">katudababile</i> in
Kiriwinian, or <i lang="kij">sama&rsquo;upa</i> in Dobuan, are
sometimes exported from Sinaketa to Dobu as Kula gifts, and function
therefore as armshells. These <i lang="kij">katudababile</i>, however,
never complete the Kula ring, in the wrong direction, as they never
return to the Trobriands from the East. Part of them are absorbed into
the districts outside the Kula, part of them come back again to
Sinaketa, and join the other necklaces in their circular movement.</p>
<p>Another class of articles, which often take a subsidiary part in the
Kula exchange, consists of the large and thin polished axe blades,
called in the Kiriwinian language <i lang="kij">beku</i>. They are
never used for any practical purposes, and fulfil only the function of
tokens of wealth and objects of parade. In the Kula they would be given
as <i lang="kij">kaributu</i> (solicitary gifts), and would go both
ways. As they are quarried in Woodlark Island and polished in Kiriwina,
they would, however, move in the direction from the Trobriands to Dobu
more frequently than in the opposite one.</p>
<p>To summarise this subject, it may be said that the proper Kula
articles are on the one hand, the armshells (<i lang="kij">mwali</i>),
and the curved tusks (<i lang="kij">doga</i>); and, on the other hand,
the fine, long necklaces (<i lang="kij">soulava</i> or <i lang=
"kij">bagi</i>), of which there are many sub-classes. An index of the
special position of these three articles is that they are the only
ones, or at least, by far the most important ones, mentioned in the
spells. Later on, I shall enumerate all the sub-classes and varieties
of these articles.</p>
<p>Although, as we have seen, there is both a good deal of ceremony
attached to the transaction and a good deal of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb359" href="#pb359" name=
"pb359">359</a>]</span>decorum, one might even say commercial honour,
implied in the technicalities of the exchange, there is much room left
as well for quarrelling and friction. If a man obtains a very fine
valuable, which he is not already under an obligation to offer as
<i lang="kij">yotile</i> (return payment), there will be a number of
his partners, who will compete to receive it. As only one can be
successful, all the others will be thwarted and more or less offended
and full of malice. Still more room for bad blood is left in the matter
of equivalence. As the valuables exchanged cannot be measured or even
compared with one another by an exact standard; as there are no
definite correspondences or indices of correlation between the various
kinds of the valuables, it is not easy to satisfy a man who has given a
<i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> of high value. On receiving a repayment
(<i lang="kij">yotile</i>), which he does not consider equivalent, he
will not actually make a scene about it, or even show his displeasure
openly in the act. But he will feel a deep resentment, which will
express itself in frequent recriminations and abuse. These, though not
made to his partner&rsquo;s face, will reach his ears sooner or later.
Eventually, the universal method of settling differences may be
resorted to&mdash;that of black magic, and a sorcerer will be paid to
cast some evil spell over the offending party.</p>
<p>When speaking about some celebrated <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>,
a native will praise its value in the words: &ldquo;Many men died
because of it&rdquo;&mdash;which does not mean that they died in battle
or fight, but were killed by black magic. Again, there is a system of
signs by which one can recognise, on inspecting the corpse the day
after death, for what reasons it has been bewitched. Among these signs
there are one or two which mean that the man has been done away with,
because of his success in Kula, or because he has offended somebody in
connection with it. The mixture of punctilio and decorum, on the one
hand, with passionate resentment and greed on the other, must be
realised as underlying all the transactions, and giving the leading
psychological tone to the natives&rsquo; interest. The obligation of
fairness and decency is based on the general rule, that it is highly
improper and dishonourable to be mean. Thus, though a man will
generally strive to belittle the thing received, it must not be
forgotten that the man who gave it was genuinely eager to do his best.
And after all, in some cases when a man receives a really fine
valuable, he will boast of it and be frankly satisfied. <span class=

a success is attributed of course not to his partner&rsquo;s
generosity, but to his own magic.</p>
<p>A feature which is universally recognised as reprehensible and
discreditable, is a tendency to retain a number of valuables and be
slow in passing them on. A man who did this would be called &ldquo;hard
in the Kula.&rdquo; The following is a native description of this
feature as exhibited by the natives of the Amphletts.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Gumasila, their Kula is very hard; they are
mean, they are retentive. They would like to take hold of one <i lang=
"kij">soulava</i>, of two, of three big ones, of four perhaps. A man
would <i lang="kij">pokala</i> them, he would <i lang=
"kij">pokapokala</i>; if he is a kinsman he will get a <i lang=
"kij">soulava</i>. The Kayleula only, and the Gumasila are mean. The
Dobu, the Du&rsquo;a&rsquo;u, the Kitava are good. Coming to
Muyuwa&mdash;they are like Gumasila.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that a man in Gumasila would let a number of necklaces
accumulate in his possession; would require plenty of food as <i lang=
"kij">pokala</i>&mdash;a characteristic reduplication describes the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e12327" title=
"Source: insistance">insistence</span> and perseverance in <i lang=
"kij">pokala</i>&mdash;and even then he would give a necklace to a
kinsman only. When I inquired from the same informant whether such a
mean man would also run a risk of being killed by sorcery, he
answered</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">

<p class="first">Returning now to the concrete proceedings of the Kula,
let us follow the movements of a Sinaketan <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>.
He has presumably received a necklace or two on his arrival; but he has
more partners and he expects more valuables. Before he receives his
fill, he has to keep a taboo. He may not partake of any local food,
neither yams, nor coco-nuts, nor betel pepper or nut. According to
their belief, if he transgressed this taboo he would not receive any
more valuables. He tries also to soften the heart of his partner by
feigning disease. He will remain in his canoe and send word that he is
ill. The Dobu man will know what such a conventional disease means.
None the less, he may yield to this mode of persuasion. If this ruse
does not succeed, the man may have recourse to magic. There is a
formula called <i lang="kij">kwoygapani</i> or &lsquo;enmeshing
magic,&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb361" href="#pb361" name=
"pb361">361</a>]</span>which seduces the mind of a man on whom it is
practised, makes him silly, and thus amenable to persuasion. The
formula is recited over a betel-nut or two, and these are given to the
partner and to his wife or sister.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Kwoygapani Spell</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;O <i lang="kij">kwega</i> leaf; O friendly
<i lang="kij">kwega</i> leaf; O <i lang="kij">kwega</i> leaf hither; O
<i lang="kij">kwega</i> leaf thither!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall enter through the mouth of the woman of Dobu; I shall
come out through the mouth of the man of Dobu. I shall enter through
the mouth of the man of Dobu; I shall come out through the mouth of the

<p>&ldquo;Seducing <i lang="kij">kwega</i> leaf; enmeshing <i lang=
"kij">kwega</i> leaf; the mind of the woman of Dobu is seduced by the
<i lang="kij">kwega</i> leaf, is enmeshed by the <i lang=
"kij">kwega</i> leaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression &ldquo;is seduced,&rdquo; &ldquo;is enmeshed
&ldquo;by the <i lang="kij">kwega</i> leaf, is repeated with a string
of words such as: &ldquo;Thy mind, O man of Dobu,&rdquo; &ldquo;thy
refusal, O woman of Dobu,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thy disinclination, O woman of
Dobu,&rdquo; &ldquo;Thy bowels, thy tongue, thy liver,&rdquo; going
thus over all the organs of understanding and feeling, and over the
words which describe these faculties. The last part is identical with
that of one or two formul&aelig; previously quoted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more it is my mother; my mother art thou, O woman of Dobu,
etc.&rdquo; (Compare the Kaykakaya and Ka&rsquo;ubana&rsquo;i spells of
the previous chapter.)</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><i lang="kij">Kwega</i> is a plant, probably belonging to the same
family as betel pepper, and its leaves are chewed with areca-nut and
lime, when real betel-pods (<i lang="kij">mwayye</i>) are not
available. The <i lang="kij">kwega</i> is, remarkably enough, invoked
in more than one magical formula, instead of the real betel-pod. The
middle part is quite clear. In it, the seducing and enmeshing power of
the <i lang="kij">kwega</i> is cast over all the mental faculties of
the Dobuan, and on the anatomical seats of these faculties. After the
application of this magic, all the resources of the soliciting man are
exhausted. He has to give up hope, and take to eating the fruit of
Dobu, as his taboo lapses.</p>
<p>Side by side with the Kula, the subsidiary exchange of ordinary
goods takes place. In <a href="#div6.6">Chapter VI, Division VI</a>, we
have classified the various types of <i>give and take</i>, as they are
to be found in the Trobriand Islands. The inter-tribal transactions
which now take place in Dobu also fit into that scheme. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb362" href="#pb362" name="pb362">362</a>]</span>The
Kula itself belongs to class (6), &lsquo;Ceremonial Barter with
deferred payment.&rsquo; The offering of the <i lang="kij">pari</i>, of
landing gifts by the visitors, returned by the <i lang=
"kij">talo&rsquo;i</i> or farewell gifts from the hosts fall into the
class (4) of presents more or less equivalent. Finally, between the
visitors and the local people there takes place, also, barter pure and
simple (<i lang="kij">gimwali</i>). Between partners, however, there is
never a direct exchange of the <i lang="kij">gimwali</i> type. The
local man will as a rule contribute a bigger present, for the <i lang=
"kij">talo&rsquo;i</i> always exceeds the <i lang="kij">pari</i> in
quantity and value, and small presents are also given to the visitors
during their stay. Of course, if in the <i lang="kij">pari</i> there
were included gifts of high value, like a stone blade or a good lime
spoon, such solicitary gifts would always be returned in strictly
equivalent form. The rest would be liberally exceeded in value.</p>
<p>The trade takes place between the visitors and local natives, who
are not their partners, but who must belong to the community with whom
the Kula is made. Thus, Numanuma, Tu&rsquo;utauna and Bwayowa are the
three communities which form what we have called the &lsquo;Kula
community&rsquo; or &lsquo;Kula unit,&rsquo; with whom the Sinaketans
stand in the relation of partnership. And a Sinaketa man will <i lang=
"kij">gimwali</i> (trade) only with a man from one of these villages
who is not his personal partner. To use a native statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Some of our goods we give in <i lang=
"kij">pari</i>; some we keep back; later on, we <i lang=
"kij">gimwali</i> it. They bring their areca-nut, their sago, they put
it down. They want some article of ours, they say: &lsquo;I want this
stone blade.&rsquo; We give it, we put the betel-nut, the sago into our
canoe. If they give us, however, a not sufficient quantity, we rate
them. Then they bring more.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a clear definition of the <i lang="kij">gimwali</i>, with
haggling and adjustment of equivalence in the act.</p>
<p>When the visiting party from Sinaketa arrive, the natives from the
neighbouring districts, that is, from the small island of Dobu proper,
from the other side of Dawson Straits, from Deyde&rsquo;i, the village
to the South, will assemble in the three Kula villages. These natives
from other districts bring with them a certain amount of goods. But
they must not trade directly with the visitors from Boyowa. They must
exchange their goods with the local natives, and these again will trade
them with the Sinaketans. Thus the hosts from the Kula <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=
"pb363">363</a>]</span>community act as intermediaries in any trading
relations between the Sinaketans and the inhabitants of more remote
districts.</p>
<p>To sum up the sociology of these transactions, we may say that the
visitor enters into a threefold relation with the Dobuan natives.
First, there is his partner, with whom he exchanges general gifts on
the basis of free give and take, a type of transaction, running side by
side with the Kula proper. Then there is the local resident, not his
personal Kula partner, with whom he carries on <i lang=
"kij">gimwali</i>. Finally there is the stranger with whom an indirect
exchange is carried on through the intermediation of the local men.
With all this, it must not be imagined that the commercial aspect of
the gathering is at all conspicuous. The concourse of the natives is
great, mainly owing to their curiosity, to see the ceremonial reception
of the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> party. But if I say that every visitor
from Boyowa, brings and carries away about half-a-dozen articles, I do
not under-state the case. Some of these articles the Sinaketan has
acquired in the industrial districts of Boyowa during his preliminary
trading expedition (see <a href="#div6.3">Chapter VI, Division
III</a>). On these he scores a definite gain. A few samples of the
prices paid in Boyowa and those received in Dobu will indicate the
amount of this gain.</p>
<div class="table">

</div>
<p>This table shows in its second column the prices paid by the
Sinaketans to the industrial villages of Kuboma, a district in the
Northern Trobriands. In the third column what they receive in Dobu is
recorded. The table has been obtained from a Sinaketan informant, and
it probably is far from accurate, and the transactions are sure to vary
greatly in the gain which they afford. There is no doubt, however, that
for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb364" href="#pb364" name=
"pb364">364</a>]</span>each article, the Sinaketan would ask the price
which he paid for them as well as some extra article.</p>
<p>Thus we see that there is in this transaction a definite gain
obtained by the middlemen. The natives of Sinaketa act as
intermediaries between the industrial centres of the Trobriands and
Dobu, whereas their hosts play the same r&ocirc;le between the
Sinaketans and the men from the outlying districts.</p>
<p>Besides trading and obtaining of Kula valuables, the natives of
Sinaketa visit their friends and their distant relatives, who, as we
saw before, are to be found in this district owing to migrations. The
visitors walk across the flat, fertile plain from one hamlet to the
other, enjoying some of the marvellous and unknown sights of this
district. They are shown the hot springs of Numanuma and of
Deyde&rsquo;i, which are in constant eruption. Every few minutes, the
water boils up in one spring after another of each group, throwing up
jets of spray a few metres high. The plain around these springs is
barren, with nothing but here and there a stunted kind of eucalyptus
tree. This is the only place in the whole of Eastern New Guinea where
as far as I know, eucalyptus trees are to be found. This was at least
the information of some intelligent natives, in whose company I visited
the springs, and who had travelled all over the Eastern islands and the
East end of the mainland.</p>
<p>The land-locked bays and lagoons, the Northern end of Dawson Strait,
enclosed like a lake by mountains and volcanic cones, all this must
also appear strange and beautiful to the Trobrianders. In the villages,
they are entertained by their male friends, the language spoken by both
parties being that of Dobu, which differs completely from Kiriwinian,
but which the Sinaketans learn in early youth. It is remarkable that no
one in Dobu speaks Kiriwinian.</p>
<p>As said above, no sexual relations of any description take place
between the visitors and the women of Dobu. As one of the informants
told me:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;We do not sleep with women of Dobu, for Dobu is
the final mountain (Koyaviguna Dobu); it is a taboo of the <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i> magic.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>But when I enquired, whether the results of breaking this taboo
would be baneful to their success in Kula only, the reply was that they
were afraid of breaking it, and that it was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name=
"pb365">365</a>]</span>ordained of old (<i lang="kij">tokunabogwo
ayguri</i>) that no man should interfere with the women of Dobu. As a
matter of fact, the Sinaketans are altogether afraid of the Dobuans,
and they would take good care not to offend them in any way.</p>
<p>After some three or four days&rsquo; sojourn in Dobu, the Sinaketan
fleet starts on its return journey. There is no special ceremony of
farewell. In the early morning, they receive their <i lang=
"kij">talo&rsquo;i</i> (farewell gifts) of food, betel-nut, objects of
use and sometimes also a Kula valuable is enclosed amongst the the
<i lang="kij">talo&rsquo;i</i>. Heavily laden as they are, they lighten
their canoes by means of a magic called <i lang="kij">kaylupa</i>, and
sail away northwards once more. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb366"

<p class="first">The return journey of the Sinaketan fleet is made by
following exactly the same route as the one by which they came to Dobu.
In each inhabited island, in every village, where a halt had previously
been made, they stop again, for a day or a few hours. In the hamlets of
Sanaroa, in Tewara and in the Amphletts, the partners are revisited.
Some Kula valuables are received on the way back, and all the <i lang=
"kij">talo&rsquo;i</i> gifts from those intermediate partners are also
collected on the return journey. In each of these villages people are
eager to hear about the reception which the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>
party have received in Dobu; the yield in valuables is discussed, and
comparisons are drawn between the present occasion and previous
records.</p>
<p>No magic is performed now, no ceremonial takes place, and there
would be very little indeed to say about the return journey but for two
important incidents; the fishing for spondylus shell (<i lang=
"kij">kaloma</i>) in Sanaroa Lagoon, and the display and comparison of
the yield of Kula valuables on Muwa beach.</p>
<p>The natives of Sinaketa, as we have seen in the last chapter,
acquire a certain amount of the Koya produce by means of trade. There
are, however, certain articles, useful yet unobtainable in the
Trobriands, and freely accessible in the Koya, and to these the
Trobrianders help themselves. The glassy forms of lava, known as
obsidian, can be found in great quantities over the slopes of the hills
in Sanaroa and Dobu. This article, in olden days, served the
Trobrianders as material for razors, scrapers, and sharp, delicate,
cutting instruments. <span class="corr" id="xd26e12586" title=
"Source: Pummice-stone">Pumice-stone</span> abounding in this district
is collected and carried to the Trobriands, where it is used for
polishing. Red ochre is also procured there by the visitors, and so are
the hard, basaltic stones (<i lang="kij">binabina</i>) used for
hammering and pounding and for <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367"
href="#pb367" name="pb367">367</a>]</span>magical purposes. Finally,
very fine silica sand, called <i lang="kij">maya</i>, is collected on
some of the beaches, and imported into the Trobriands, where it is used
for polishing stone blades, of the kind which serve as tokens of value
and which are manufactured up to the present day.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="div15.2" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">II</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">But by far the most important of the articles which
the Trobrianders collect for themselves are the spondylus shells. These
are freely, though by no means easily, accessible in the coral outcrops
of Sanaroa Lagoon. It is from this shell that the small circular
perforated discs (<i lang="kij">kaloma</i>) are made, out of which the
necklaces of the Kula are composed, and which also serve for
ornamenting almost all the articles of value or of artistic finish
which are used within the Kula district. But, only in two localities
within the district are these discs manufactured, in Sinaketa and in
Vakuta, both villages in Southern Boyowa. The shell can be found also
in the Trobriand Lagoon, facing these two villages. But the specimens
found in Sanaroa are much better in colour, and I think more easily
procured. The fishing in this latter locality, however, is done by the
Sinaketans only.</p>
<p>Whether the fishing is done in their own Lagoon, near an uninhabited
island called Nanoula, or in Sanaroa, it is always a big, ceremonial
affair, in which the whole community takes part in a body. The magic,
or at least part of it, is done for the whole community by the magician
of the <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> (<i lang="kij">towosina kaloma</i>),
who also fixes the dates, and conducts the ceremonial part of the
proceedings. As the spondylus shell furnishes one of the essential
episodes of a Kula expedition, a detailed account both of fishing and
of manufacturing must be here given. The native name, <i lang=
"kij">kaloma</i> (in the Southern Massim districts the word <i lang=
"kij">sapi-sapi</i> is used) describes both the shell and the
manufactured discs. The shell is the large spondylus shell, containing
a crystalline layer of a red colour, varying from dirty brick-red to a
soft, raspberry pink, the latter being by far the most prized. It lives
in the cavities of coral outcrop, scattered among shallow mud-bottomed
lagoons.</p>
<p>This shell is, according to tradition, associated with the village
of Sinaketa. According to a Sinaketan legend, once upon a time, three
<i lang="kij">guya&rsquo;u</i> (chief) women, belonging to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb368" href="#pb368" name=
"pb368">368</a>]</span>Tabalu sub-clan of the Malasi clan, wandered
along, each choosing her place to settle in. The eldest selected the
village of Omarakana; the second went to Gumilababa; the youngest
settled in Sinaketa. She had <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> discs in her
basket, and they were threaded on a long, thin stick, called <i lang=
"kij">viduna</i>, such as is used in the final stage of manufacture.
She remained first in a place called Kaybwa&rsquo;u, but a dog howled,
and she moved further on. She heard again a dog howling, and she took a
<i lang="kij">kaboma</i> (wooden plate) and went on to the fringing
reef to collect shells. She found there the <i lang="kij">momoka</i>
(white spondylus), and she exclaimed: &ldquo;Oh, this is the <i lang=
"kij">kaloma!</i>&rdquo; She looked closer, and said: &ldquo;Oh no, you
are not red. Your name is <i lang="kij">momoka</i>.&rdquo; She took
then the stick with the <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> discs and thrust it
into a hole of the reef. It stood there, but when she looked at it, she
said: &ldquo;Oh, the people from inland would come and see you and
pluck you off.&rdquo; She went, she pulled out the stick; she went into
a canoe, and she paddled. She paddled out into the sea. She anchored
there, pulled the discs off the stick, and she threw them into the sea
so that they might come into the coral outcrop. She said: &ldquo;It is
forbidden that the inland natives should take the valuables. The people
of Sinaketa only must dive.&rdquo; Thus only the Sinaketa people know
the magic, and how to dive.</p>
<p>This myth presents certain remarkable characteristics. I shall not
enter into its sociology, though it differs in that respect from the
Kiriwinian myths, in which the equality of the Sinaketan and the
Gumilababan chiefs with those of Omarakana is not acknowledged. It is
characteristic that the Malasi woman in this myth shows an aversion to
the dog, the totem animal of the Lukuba clan, a clan which according to
mythical and historical data had to recede before and yield its
priority to the Malasi (compare <a href="#div12.4">Chapter XII,
Division IV</a>). Another detail of interest is that she brings the
<i lang="kij">kaloma</i> on their sticks, as they appear in the final
stage of manufacturing. In this form, also, she tries to plant them on
the reef. The finished <i lang="kij">kaloma</i>, however, to use the
words of one of my informants, &ldquo;looked at her, the water swinging
it to and fro; flashing its red eyes.&rdquo; And the woman, seeing it,
pulls out the too accessible and too inviting <i lang="kij">kaloma</i>
and scatters them over the deep sea. Thus she makes them inaccessible
to the uninitiated inland villagers, and monopolises them for Sinaketa.
There <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href="#pb369" name=
"pb369">369</a>]</span>can be no doubt that the villages of Vakuta have
learnt this industry from the Sinaketans. The myth is hardly known in
Vakuta, only a few are experts in diving and manufacturing; there is a
tradition about a late transference of this industry there; finally the
Vakutans have never fished for <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> in the Sanaroa
Lagoon.</p>
<p>Now let us describe the technicalities and the ceremonial connected
with the fishing for <i lang="kij">kaloma</i>. It will be better to
give an account of how this is done in the Lagoon of Sinaketa, round
the sandbank of Nanoula, as this is the normal and typical form of
<i lang="kij">kaloma</i> fishing. Moreover, when the Sinaketans do it
in Sanaroa, the proceedings are very much the same, with just one or
two phases missed out.</p>
<p>The office of magician of the <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> (<i lang=
"kij">towosina kaloma</i>) is hereditary in two sub-clans, belonging to
the Malasi clan, and one of them is that of the main chief of
Kasi&rsquo;etana. After the Monsoon season is over, that is, some time
in March or April, <i lang="kij">ogibukuvi</i> (i.e., in the season of
the new yams) the magician gives the order for preparations. The
community give him a gift called <i lang="kij">sousula</i>, one or two
bringing a <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, the rest supplying <i lang=
"kij">gugu&rsquo;a</i> (ordinary chattels), and some food. Then they
prepare the canoes, and get ready the <i lang="kij">binabina</i>
stones, with which the spondylus shell will be knocked off the
reef.</p>
<p>Next day, in the morning, the magician performs a rite called
&lsquo;<i lang="kij">kaykwa&rsquo;una la&rsquo;i</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;the
attracting of the reef,&rsquo; for, as in the case of several other
marine beings, the main seat of the <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> is far
away. Its dwelling place is the reef Ketabu, somewhere between Sanaroa
and Dobu. In order to make it move and come towards Nanoula, it is
necessary to recite the above-named spell. This is done by the magician
as he walks up and down on the Sinaketa beach and casts his words into
the open, over the sea, towards the distant seat of the <i lang=
"kij">kaloma</i>. The <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> then &lsquo;stand
up&rsquo; (<i lang="kij">itolise</i>) that is start from their original
coral outcrop (<i lang="kij">vatu</i>) and come into the Lagoon of
Sinaketa. This spell, I obtained from To&rsquo;udavada, the present
chief of Kasi&rsquo;etana, and descendant of the original giver of this
shell, the woman of the myth. It begins with a long list of ancestral
names; then follows a boastful picture of how the whole fleet admires
the magical success of the magician&rsquo;s spell. The key-word in the
main part is the word &lsquo;<i lang="kij">itolo</i>&rsquo;: &lsquo;it
stands up,&rsquo; i.e., &lsquo;it starts,&rsquo; and with this, there
are enumerated all the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href=
"#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span>various classes of the <i lang=
"kij">kaloma</i> shell, differentiated according to size, colour and
quality. It ends up with another boast; &ldquo;My canoe is <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e12729" title="Source: overladed">overloaded</span> with
shell so that it sinks,&rdquo; which is repeated with varying
phraseology.</p>

<p>This spell the magician may utter once only, or he may repeat it
several times on successive days. He fixes then the final date for the
fishing expedition. On the evening before that date, the men perform
some private magic, every one in his own house. The hammering stone,
the <i lang="kij">gabila</i>, which is always a <i lang=
"kij">binabina</i> (it is a stone imported from the Koya), is charmed
over. As a rule it is put on a piece of dried banana leaf with some red
hibiscus blossoms and leaves or flowers of red colour. A formula is
uttered over it, and the whole is then wrapped up in the banana leaf
and kept there until it is used. This will make the stone a lucky one
in hitting off many shells, and it will make the shells very red.</p>
<p>Another rite of private magic consists in charming a large mussel
shell, with which, on the next morning, the body of the canoe will be
scraped. This makes the sea clear, so that the diver may easily see and
frequently find his spondylus shells.</p>
<p>Next morning the whole <span class="corr" id="xd26e12766" title=
"Source: fleets">fleet</span> starts on the expedition. Some food has
been taken into the canoes, as the fishing usually lasts for a few
days, the nights being spent on the beach of Nanoula. When the canoes
arrive at a certain point, about half-way between Sinaketa and Nanoula,
they all range themselves in a row. The canoe of the magician is at the
right flank, and he medicates a bunch of red hibiscus flowers, some red
croton leaves, and the leaves of the red-blossomed mangrove&mdash;red
coloured substances being used to make the shell red, magically. Then,
passing in front of all the other canoes, he rubs their prows with the
bundle of leaves. After that, the canoes at both ends of the row begin
to punt along, the row evolving into a circle, through which presently
the canoe of the magician passes, punting along its diameter. At this
place in the Lagoon, there is a small <i lang="kij">vatu</i> (coral
outcrop) called Vitukwayla&rsquo;i. This is called the <i lang=
"kij">vatu</i> of the <i lang="kij">baloma</i> (spirits). At this
<i lang="kij">vatu</i> the magician&rsquo;s canoe stops, and he orders
some of its crew to dive down and here to begin the gathering of
shells.</p>
<p>Some more private magic is performed later on by each canoe on its
own account. The anchor stone is charmed <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb371" href="#pb371" name="pb371">371</a>]</span>with some red
hibiscus flowers, in order to make the spondylus shell red. There is
another private magic called &lsquo;sweeping of the sea,&rsquo; which,
like the magic of the mussel shell, mentioned above, makes the sea
clear and transparent. Finally, there is an evil magic called
&lsquo;besprinkling with salt water.&rsquo; If a man does it over the
others, he will annul the effects of their magic, and frustrate their
efforts, while he himself would arouse astonishment and suspicion by
the amount of shell collected. Such a man would dive down into the
water, take some brine into his mouth, and emerging, spray it towards
the other canoes, while he utters the evil charm.</p>
<p>So much for the magic and the ceremonial associated with the
spondylus fishing in the Trobriand Lagoon. In Sanaroa, exactly the same
proceedings take place, except that there is no attracting of the reef,
probably because they are already at the original seat of the <i lang=
"kij">kaloma</i>. Again I was told that some of the private magic would
be performed in Sinaketa before the fleet sailed on the Kula
expedition. The objects medicated would be then kept, well wrapped in
dried leaves.</p>
<p>It may be added that neither in the one Lagoon nor in the other are
there any private, <span class="corr" id="xd26e12792" title=
"Source: proprietory">proprietary</span> rights to coral outcrops. The
whole community of Sinaketa have their fishing grounds in the Lagoon,
within which every man may hunt for his spondylus shell, and catch his
fish at times. If the other spondylus fishing community, the Vakutans,
encroached upon their grounds, there would be trouble, and in olden
days, fighting. Private ownership in coral outcrops exists in the
Northern villages of the Lagoon, that is in Kavataria, and the villages
on the island of Kayleula.</p>

<p class="first">We must now follow the later stages of the <i lang=
"kij">kaloma</i> industry. The technology of the proceedings is so
mixed up with remarkable sociological and economic arrangements that it
will be better to indicate it first in its main outlines. The spondylus
consists of a shell, the size and shape of a hollowed out half of a
pear, and of a flat, small lid. It is only the first part which is
worked. First it has to be broken into pieces with a <i lang=
"kij">binabina</i> or an <i lang="kij">utukema</i> (green stone
imported from Woodlark Island) as shown on <a href="#pl50">Plate L
(<span class="sc">A</span>)</a>. On each piece, then, can be seen the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb372" href="#pb372" name=
"pb372">372</a>]</span>stratification of the shell: the outside layer
of soft, chalky substance; under this, the layer of red, hard,
calcareous material, and then the inmost, white, crystalline stratum.
Both the outside and inside have to be rubbed off, but first each piece
has to be roughly rounded up, so as to form a thick circular lump. Such
a lump (see foregrounds of <a href="#pl50">Plates L (<span class=
"sc">A</span>)</a>, <a href="#pl50">L (<span class="sc">B</span>)</a>)
is then put in the hole of a cylindrical piece of wood. This latter
serves as a handle with which the lumps are rubbed on a piece of flat
sandstone (see <a href="#pl50">Plate L (<span class=
"sc">B</span>)</a>). The rubbing is carried on so far till the outside
and inside layers are gone, and there remains only a red, flat tablet,
polished on both sides. In the middle of it, a hole is drilled through
by means of a pump drill&mdash;<i lang=
"kij">gigi&rsquo;u</i>&mdash;(see <a href="#pl51">Plate LI</a>), and a
number of such perforated discs are then threaded on a thin, but tough
stick (see <a href="#pl52">Plate LII</a>), with which we have already
met in the myth. Then the cylindrical roll is rubbed round and round on
the flat sandstone, until its form becomes perfectly symmetrical (see
<a href="#pl52">Plate LII</a>). Thus a number of flat, circular discs,
polished all round and perforated in the middle, are produced. The
breaking and the drilling, like the diving are done exclusively by men.
The polishing is as a rule woman&rsquo;s work.</p>

contour still, are now threaded on to a thin, tough stick, and in this
form they are ground on a flat sandstone till the roll is cylindrical,
that is, each disc is a perfect circle. (See <a href="#div15.3">Div.
III</a>.)</p>
</div>
<p>This technology is associated with an interesting sociological
relation between the maker and the man for whom the article is made. As
has been stated in <a href="#ch2">Chapter II</a>, one of the main
features of the Trobriand organisation consists of the mutual duties
between a man and his wife&rsquo;s maternal kinsmen. They have to
supply him regularly with yams at harvest time, while he gives them the
present of a valuable now and then. The manufacture of <i lang=
"kij">kaloma</i> valuables in Sinaketa is very often associated with
this relationship. The Sinaketan manufacturer makes his <i lang=
"kij">kutadababile</i> (necklace of large beads) for one of his
relatives-in-law, while this latter pays him in food. In accordance
with this custom, it happens very frequently that a Sinaketan man
marries a woman from one of the agricultural inland villages, or even a
woman of Kiriwina. Of course, if he has no relatives-in-law in one of
these villages, he will have friends or distant relatives, and he will
make the string for one or the other of them. Or else he will produce
one for himself, and launch it into the Kula. But the most typical and
interesting case is, when the necklace is produced to order for a man
who repays it according to a remarkable economic system, a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb373" href="#pb373" name=
"pb373">373</a>]</span>system similar to the payments in instalments,
which I have mentioned with regard to canoe making. I shall give here,
following closely the native text, a translation of an account of the
payments for <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> making.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="main">Account of the Kaloma Making</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Supposing some man from inland lives in Kiriwina or in
Luba or in one of the villages nearby; he wants a <i lang=
"kij">katudababile</i>. He would request an expert fisherman who knows
how to dive for <i lang="kij">kaloma</i>. This man agrees; he dives, he
dives &hellip; till it is sufficient; his <i lang="kij">vataga</i>
(large folding basket) is already full, this man (the inlander) hears
the rumour; he, the master of the <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> (that is,
the man for whom the necklace will be made) says: &ldquo;Good! I shall
just have a look!&rdquo; He would come, he would see, he would not give
any <i lang="kij">vakapula</i> payment. He (here the Sinaketan diver is
meant) would say: &ldquo;Go, tomorrow, I shall break the shell, come
here, give me <i lang="kij">vakapula</i>.&rdquo; Next day, he (the
inlander) would cook food, he would bring, he would give <i lang=
"kij">vakapula</i>; he (the diver) would break the shell. Next day, the
same. He (the inlander) would give the <i lang="kij">vakapula</i>, he
(the diver) would break the shell. Supposing the breaking is already
finished, he (the diver) would say: &ldquo;Good! already the breaking
is finished, I shall polish.&rdquo; Next day, he (the inlander) would
cook food, would bring bananas, coco-nut, betel-nut, sugar cane, would
give it as <i lang="kij">vakapula</i>; this man (the diver) polishes.
The polishing already finished, he would speak: &ldquo;Good! To-morrow
I shall drill.&rdquo; This man (the inlander) would bring food,
bananas, coco-nuts, sugar cane, he would give it as <i lang=
"kij">vakapula</i>: it would be abundant, for soon already the necklace
will be finished. The same, he would give a big <i lang=
"kij">vakapula</i> on the occasion of the rounding up of the cylinder,
for soon everything will be finished. When finished, we thread it on a
string, we wash it. (Note the change from the third singular into the
first plural). We give it to our wife, we blow the conch shell; she
would go, she would carry his valuable to this man, our
relative-in-law. Next day, he would <i lang="kij">yomelu</i>; he would
catch a pig, he would break off a bunch of betel-nut, he would cut
sugar cane, bananas, he would fill the baskets with food, and spike the
coco-nut on a multi-forked piece of wood. By-and-by he would bring it.
Our house would be filled up. Later on we would make a distribution of
the bananas, of the sugar cane, of the betel-nut. We give it to our
helpers. We sit, we sit (i.e., we wait); at harvest <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb374" href="#pb374" name="pb374">374</a>]</span>time
he brings yams, he <i lang="kij">karibudaboda</i> (he gives the payment
of that name), the necklace. He would bring the food and fill out our
yam house.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This narrative, like many pieces of native information, needs
certain corrections of perspective. In the first place, events here
succeed one another with a rapidity quite foreign to the extremely
leisurely way in which natives usually accomplish such a lengthy
process as the making of a <i lang="kij">katudababile</i>. The amount
of food which, in the usual manner, is enumerated over and over again
in this narrative would probably not be exaggerated, for&mdash;such is
native economy&mdash;a man who makes a necklace to order would get
about twice as much or even more for it than it would fetch in any
other transaction. On the other hand, it must be remembered that what
is represented here as the final payment, the <i lang=
"kij">karibudaboda</i>, is nothing else but the normal filling up of
the yam house, always done by a man&rsquo;s relations-in-law. None the
less, in a year in which a <i lang="kij">katudababile</i> would be
made, the ordinary yearly harvest gift would be styled the
&lsquo;<i lang="kij">karibudaboda</i> payment for the necklace.&rsquo;
The giving of the necklace to the wife, who afterwards carries it to
her brother or kinsman, is also characteristic of the relation between
relatives-in-law.</p>
<p>In Sinaketa and Vakuta only the necklaces made of bigger shell and
tapering towards the end are made. The real Kula article, in which the
discs are much thinner, smaller in diameter and even in size from one
end of the necklace to the other, these were introduced into the Kula
at other points, and I shall speak about this subject in one of the
following chapters (<a href="#ch21">Chapter XXI</a>), where the other
branches of the Kula are described.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Now, having come to an end of this digression on
<i lang="kij">kaloma</i>, let us return for another short while to our
Sinaketan party, whom we have left on the Lagoon of Sanaroa. Having
obtained a sufficient amount of the shells, they set sail, and
re-visiting Tewara and Gumasila, stopping perhaps for a night on one of
the sandbanks of Pilolu, they arrive at last in their home Lagoon. But
before rejoining their people in their villages, they stop for the last
halt on Muwa. Here they make what <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb375"
href="#pb375" name="pb375">375</a>]</span>is called <i lang=
"kij">tanarere</i>, a comparison and display of the valuables obtained
on this trip. From each canoe, a mat or two are spread on the sand
beach, and the men put their necklaces on the mat. Thus a long row of
valuables lies on the beach, and the members of the expedition walk up
and down, admire, and count them. The chiefs would, of course, have
always the greatest haul, more especially the one who has been the
<i lang="kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i> on that expedition.</p>
<p>After this is over, they return to the village. Each canoe blows its
conch shell, a blast for each valuable that it contains. When a canoe
has obtained no <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> at all, this means
great shame and distress for its members, and especially for the
<i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>. Such a canoe is said to <i lang=
"kij">bisikureya</i>, which means literally &lsquo;to keep a
fast.&rsquo;</p>
<p>On the beach all the villagers are astir. The women, who have put on
their new grass petticoats (<i lang="kij">sevata&rsquo;i</i>) specially
made for this occasion, enter the water and approach the canoes to
unload them. No special greetings pass between them and their husbands.
They are interested in the food brought from Dobu, more especially in
the sago.</p>
<p>People from other villages assemble also in great numbers to greet
the incoming party. Those who have supplied their friends or relatives
with provisions for their journey, receive now sago, betel-nuts and
coco-nuts in repayment. Some of the welcoming crowd have come in order
to make Kula. Even from the distant districts of Luba and Kiriwina
natives will travel to Sinaketa, having a fair idea of the date of the
arrival of the Kula party from Dobu. The expedition will be talked
over, the yield counted, the recent history of the important valuables
described. But this stage leads us already into the subject of inland
Kula, which will form the subject of one of the following chapters.

<p class="first">In the twelve preceding chapters, we have followed an
expedition from Sinaketa to Dobu. But branching off at almost every
step from its straight track, we studied the various associated
institutions and underlying beliefs; we quoted magical formul&aelig;,
and told mythical stories, and thus we broke up the continuous thread
of the narrative. In this chapter, as we are already acquainted with
the customs, beliefs and institutions implied in the Kula, we are ready
to follow a straight and consecutive tale of an expedition in the
inverse direction, from Dobu to Sinaketa.</p>
<p>As I have seen, indeed followed, a big <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>
expedition from the South to the Trobriands, I shall be able to give
some of the scenes from direct impression, and not from reconstruction.
Such a reconstruction for one who has seen much of the natives&rsquo;
tribal life and has a good grip over intelligent informants is neither
very difficult nor need it be fanciful at all. Indeed, towards the end
of my second visit, I had several times opportunities to check such a
reconstruction by witnessing the actual occurrence, for after my first
year&rsquo;s stay in the Trobriands I had written out already some of
my material. As a rule, even in minute details, my reconstructions
hardly differed from reality, as the tests have shown. None the less,
it is possible for an Ethnographer to enter into concrete details with
more conviction when he describes things actually seen.</p>

<p class="figureHead">On the Beach of Nabwageta.</p>
<p>In the middle of the picture a sail is seen, hung on a scaffolding
of sticks; natives are pausing in their work of overhauling it and
patching it up. (See <a href="#div16.1">Div. I</a>.)</p>
</div>
<p>In September, 1917, an <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> expedition was led
by Kouta&rsquo;uya from Sinaketa to Dobu. The Vakutans joining them on
the way, and the canoes of the Amphletts following them also, some
forty canoes finally arrived at the western shore of Dawson Straits. It
was arranged then and there that a return expedition from that district
should visit Sinaketa in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href=
"#pb377" name="pb377">377</a>]</span>about six months&rsquo; time.
Kauyaporu, the <i lang="kij">esa&rsquo;esa</i> (headman) of
Kesora&rsquo;i hamlet in the village of Bwayowa, had a pig with
circular tusks. He decided therefore to arrange an <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> expedition, at the beginning of which the pig was to
be killed and feasted upon and its tusks turned into ornaments.</p>
<p>When, in November, 1917, I passed through the district, the
preparing of the canoes was already afoot. All of those, which still
could be repaired, had been taken to pieces and were being relashed,
recaulked and repainted. In some hamlets, new dug-outs were being
scooped. After a few months stay in the Trobriands, I went South again
in March, 1918, intending to spend some time in the Amphletts. Landing
there is always difficult, as there are no anchorages near the shore,
and it is quite impossible to disembark in rough weather at night. I
arrived late in a small cutter, and had to cruise between Gumasila and
Domdom, intending to wait till daybreak and then effect a landing. In
the middle of the night, however, a violent north-westerly squall came
down, and making a split in the main-sail, forced us to run before the
wind, southwards towards Dobu. It was on this night that the native
boys employed in the boat, saw the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> flaming
up at the head of the mast. The wind dropped before daybreak, and we
entered the Lagoon of Sanaroa, in order to repair the sail. During the
three days we stopped there, I roamed over the country, climbing its
volcanic cones, paddling up the creeks and visiting the villages
scattered on the coral plain. Everywhere I saw signs of the approaching
departure for Boyowa; the natives preparing their canoes on the beach
to be loaded, collecting food in the gardens and making sago in the
jungle. At the head of one of the creeks, in the midst of a sago swamp,
there was a long, low shelter which serves as a dwelling to Dobuan
natives from the main Island when they come to gather sago. This swamp
was said to be reserved to a certain community of Tu&rsquo;utauna.</p>
<p>Another day I came upon a party of local natives from Sanaroa, who
were pounding sago pulp out of a palm, and sluicing it with water. A
big tree had been felled, its bark stripped in the middle of the trunk
in a large square, and the soft, fleshy interior laid open. There were
three men standing in a row before it and pounding away at it. A few
more men waited to relieve the tired ones. The pounding instruments,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb378" href="#pb378" name=
"pb378">378</a>]</span>half club, half adzes, had thick but not very
broad blades of green stone, of the same type as I have seen among the
Mailu natives of the South Coast.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e13048src"
href="#xd26e13048" name="xd26e13048src">1</a></p>
<p>The pulp was then carried in baskets to a neighbouring stream. At
this spot there was a natural trough, one of the big, convex scales,
which form the basis of the sago leaf. In the middle of it, a sieve was
made of a piece of coco-nut spathing, a fibre which covers the root of
a coco-nut leaf, and looks at first sight exactly like a piece of
roughly woven material. Water was directed so that it flowed into the
trough at its broad end, coming out at the narrow one. The sago pulp
was put at the top, the water carried away with it the powdered sago
starch, while the wooden, husky fibres were retained by the sieve. The
starch was then carried with the water into a big wooden canoe-shaped
trough; there the heavier starch settled down, while the water welled
over the brim. When there is plenty of starch, the water is drained off
carefully and the starch is placed into another of the trough-shaped,
sago leaf bases, where it is allowed to dry. In such receptacles it is
then carried on a trading expedition, and is thus counted as one unit
of sago.</p>
<p>I watched the proceedings for a long time with great interest. There
is something fascinating about the big, antideluvian-looking sago palm,
so malignant and unapproachable in its unhealthy, prickly swamp, being
turned by man into food by such simple and direct methods. The sago
produced and eaten by the natives is a tough, starchy stuff, of dirty
white colour, very unpalatable. It has the consistency of rubber, and
the taste of very poor, unleavened bread. It is not clear, like the
article which is sold under the name of sago in our groceries, but is
mealy, tough, and almost elastic. The natives consider it a great
delicacy, and bake it into little cakes, or boil it into dumplings.</p>
<p>The main fleet of the Dobuans started some time in the second half
of March from their villages, and went first to the beach of
Sarubwoyna, where they held a ceremonial distribution of food, <i lang=
"kij">eguya&rsquo;i</i>, as it is called in Dobu. Then, offering the
<i lang="kij">pokala</i> to Aturamo&rsquo;a and Atu&rsquo;a&rsquo;ine,
they sailed by way of Sanaroa and Tewara, passing the tabooed rock of
Gurewaya to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href="#pb379" name=
"pb379">379</a>]</span>the Amphletts. The wind was light and
changeable, weak S.W. breezes prevailing. The progress of this stage of
the journey must have been very slow. The natives must have spent a few
nights on the intermediate islands and sandbanks, a few canoes&rsquo;
crews camping at one spot.</p>
<p>At that time I had already succeeded in reaching the Amphletts, and
had been busy for two or three weeks doing ethnographic work, though
not very successfully; for, as I have already once or twice remarked,
the natives here are very bad informants. I knew of course that the
Dobuan fleet was soon to come, but as my experience had taught me to
mistrust native time-tables and fixtures of date, I did not expect them
to be punctual. In this, however, I was mistaken. On a Kula expedition,
when the dates are once fixed, the natives make real and strenuous
efforts to keep to them. In the Amphletts the people were busy
preparing for the expedition, because they had the intention of joining
the Dobuans and proceeding with them to the Trobriands. A few canoes
went to the mainland to fetch sago, pots were being mustered and made
ready for stowing away, canoes were overhauled. When the small
expedition returned from the mainland with sago, after a week or so, a
<i lang="kij">sagali</i> (in Amphlettan<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e13070" title="Source: ;">:</span> <i lang="kij">madare</i>), that
is, a ceremonial distribution of food was held on the neighbouring
island, Nabwageta.</p>
<p>My arrival was a very untoward event to the natives, and complicated
matters, causing great annoyance to Tovasana, the main headman. I had
landed in his own little village, Nu&rsquo;agasi, on the island of
Gumasila, for it was impossible to anchor near the big village, nor
would there have been room for pitching a tent. Now, in the Amphletts,
a white man is an exceedingly rare occurrence, and to my knowledge,
only once before, a white trader remained there for a few weeks. To
leave me alone with the women and one or two old men was impossible,
according to their ideas and fears, and none of the younger men wanted
to forgo the privilege and pleasure of taking part in the expedition.
At last, I promised them to move to the neighbouring island of
Nabwageta, as soon as the men were gone, and with this they were
satisfied.</p>
<p>As the date fixed for the arrival of the Dobuans approached, the
excitement grew. Little by little the news arrived, and was eagerly
received and conveyed to me: &ldquo;Some sixty canoes <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href="#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>of
the Dobuans are coming,&rdquo; &ldquo;the fleet is anchored off
Tewara,&rdquo; &ldquo;each canoe is heavily laden with food and
gifts,&rdquo; &ldquo;Kauyaporu sails in his canoe, he is <i lang=
"kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i>, and has a big pandanus streamer attached
to the prow.&rdquo; A string of other names followed which had very
little meaning for me, since I was not acquainted with the Dobuan
natives. From another part of the world, from the Trobriands, the goal
of the whole expedition, news reached us again: &ldquo;To&rsquo;uluwa,
the chief of Kiriwina has gone to Kitava&mdash;he will soon come back,
bringing plenty of <i lang="kij">mwali</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Sinaketans are going there to fetch some of the <i lang=
"kij">mwali</i>.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Vakutans have been in Kitava and
brought back great numbers of <i lang="kij">mwali</i>.&rdquo; It was
astonishing to hear all this news, arriving at a small island,
apparently completely isolated with its tiny population, within these
savage and little navigated seas; news only a few days old, yet
reporting events which had occurred at a travelling distance of some
hundred miles.</p>
<p>It was interesting to follow up the way it had come. The earlier
news about the Dobuans had been brought by the canoes, which had
fetched the sago to Gumasila from the main island. A few days later, a
canoe from one of the main island villages had arrived here, and on its
way had passed the Dobuans in Tewara. The news from the Trobriands in
the North had been brought by the Kuyawa canoe which had arrived a
couple of days before in Nabwageta (and whose visit to Nu&rsquo;agasi I
have described in <a href="#ch11">Chapter XI</a>). All these movements
were not accidental, but connected with the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>
expedition. To show the complexity, as well as the precise timing of
the various movements and events, so perfectly synchronised over a vast
area, in connection with the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>, I have
tabulated them in the Chart, facing this page, in which almost all the
dates are quite exact, being based on my own observations. This Chart
also gives a clear, synoptic picture of an <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>,
and it will be useful to refer to it, in reading this Chapter.</p>
<p>In olden days, not less than now, there must have been an
<span class="corr" id="xd26e13111" title=
"Source: ebulition">ebullition</span> in the inter-tribal relations,
and a great stirring from one place to another, whenever an <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> Kula was afoot. Thus, news would be carried rapidly
over great distances, the movements of the vast numbers of natives
would be co-ordinated, and dates fixed. As has been said already, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name=
"pb382">382</a>]</span>culminating event of an expedition, in this case
the arrival of the Dobuan fleet in Sinaketa, would be always so timed
as to happen on, or just before, a full moon, and this would serve as a
general orientation for the preliminary movements, such as in this
case, the visits of the single canoes. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Indeed, from that moment, the events on and about the Amphlett
Islands moved rapidly. The day after the visit from the Kuyawan canoes,
the canoes of the main village of Gumasila sailed off to the
Trobriands, starting therefore a few days ahead of the Dobuan <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> fleet. I rowed over in a dinghy to the big village,
and watched the loading and departing of the canoes. There was a bustle
in the village, and even a few old women could be seen helping the men
in their tasks. The large canoes were being pushed into the water from
their supports, on which they were beached. They had been already
prepared for the journey there, their platforms covered with plaited
palm leaves, frames put in their bottoms to support the cargo, boards
placed crossways within the canoe to serve as seats for the crew, the
mast, rigging and sail laid handy. The loading, however, begins only
after the canoe is in water. The large, trough-shaped chunks of sago
were put at the bottom, while men and women carefully brought out the
big clay pots, stowing them away with many precautions in special
places in the middle (see <a href="#pl47">Plate XLVII</a>). Then, one
after the other, the canoes went off, paddling round the southern end
of the island towards the West. At about ten o&rsquo;clock in the
morning, the last canoe disappeared round the promontory, and the
village remained practically empty. There was no saying of farewells,
not a trace of any emotion on the part of those leaving or those
remaining. But it must be remembered that, owing to my presence, no
women except one or two old hags, were visible on the shore. All my
best informants gone, I intended to move to Nabwageta next morning. At
sunset, I made a long excursion in my dinghy round the western shores
of Gumasila, and it was on that occasion that I discovered all those
who had left that morning on the Kula sitting on Giyasila beach, in
accordance with the Kula custom of a preliminary halt, such as the one
on Muwa described in <a href="#ch7">Chapter VII</a>.</p>
<p>Next morning, I left for the neighbouring island and village of
Nabwageta, and only after he saw me safely off, Tovasana and his party
left in his canoe, following the others to Vakuta. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb383" href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span>In
Nabwageta, the whole community were in the midst of their final
preparations for departure, for they intended to wait for the Dobuans
and sail with them to Kiriwina. All their canoes were being painted and
renovated, a sail was being repaired on the beach (see <a href=
"#pl53">Plate LIII</a>). There were some minor distributions of food
taking place in the village, the stuff being over and over again
allotted and re-allotted, smaller pieces carved out of the big chunks
and put into special wrappings. This constant handling of food is one
of the most prominent features of tribal life in that part of the
world. As I arrived, a sail for one of the canoes was just being
finished by a group of men. In another canoe, I saw them mending the
outrigger by attaching the small log of light, dry wood to make the
old, waterlogged float more buoyant. I could also watch in detail the
final trimming of the canoes, the putting up of the additional frames,
of the coco-nut mats, the making of the little cage in the central part
for the pots and for the <i lang="kij">lilava</i> (the sacred bundle),
I was, nevertheless, not on sufficiently intimate terms with these
Nabwageta natives to be allowed to witness any of the magic. Their
system of <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> is identical with that of Boyowa,
in fact, it is borrowed from there.</p>
<p>Next day&mdash;in this village again I had difficulty in finding any
good informants, a difficulty increased by the feverish occupation of
all the men&mdash;I went for a long row in the afternoon with my two
&lsquo;boys,&rsquo; hoping to reach the island of Domdom. A strong
current, which in this part is at places so pronounced that it breaks
out into steep, tidal waves, made it impossible to reach our goal.
Returning in the dark, my boys suddenly grew alert and excited, like
hounds picking up a scent. I could perceive nothing in the dark, but
they had discerned two canoes moving westwards. Within about
half-an-hour, a fire became visible, twinkling on the beach of a small,
deserted island South of Domdom; evidently some Dobuans were camping
there. The excitement and intense interest shown by my boys, one a
Dobuan, the other from Sariba (Southern Massim), gave me an inkling of
the magnitude of this event&mdash;the vanguard of a big Kula fleet
slowly creeping up towards one of its intermediate halting places. It
also brought home to me vividly the inter-tribal character of this
institution, which unites in one common and strongly emotional interest
so many scattered communities. That night, as we learnt afterwards, a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb384" href="#pb384" name=
"pb384">384</a>]</span>good number of canoes had anchored on the
outlying deserted islands of the Amphletts, waiting for the rest of the
fleet to arrive. When we came that evening to Nabwageta, the news had
already been received of the important event, and the whole village was
astir.</p>
<p>Next day, the weather was particularly fine and clear, with the
distant mountains wreathed only in light cumuli, their alluring
outlines designed in transparent blue. Early in the afternoon, with a
blast of conch shell, a Dobuan waga, in full paint and decoration, and
with the rich pandanus mat of the sail glowing like gold against the
blue sea, came sailing round the promontory. One after the other, at
intervals of a few minutes each, other canoes came along, all sailing
up to some hundred yards from the beach, and then, after furling the
sail, paddling towards the shore (see <a href="#pl40">Plate XL</a>).
This was not a ceremonial approach, as the aim of the expedition this
time did not embrace the Amphletts, but was directed towards the
Trobriands only, Vakuta, and Sinaketa; these canoes had put in only for
an intermediate halt. Nevertheless, it was a great event, especially as
the canoes of Nabwageta were going to join with the fleet later on. Out
of the sixty or so Dobuan canoes, only about twenty-five with some 250
men in them had come to Nabwageta, the others having gone to the big
village of Gumasila. In any case, there were about five times as many
men gathered in the village as one usually sees. There was no Kula done
at all, no conch-shells were blown on the shore, nor do I think were
any presents given or received by either party. The men sat in groups
round their friends&rsquo; houses, the most distinguished visitors
collected about the dwelling of Tobwa&rsquo;ina, the main headman of
Nabwageta.</p>
<p>Many canoes were anchored along the coast beyond the village beach,
some tucked away into small coves, others moored in sheltered shallows.
The men sat on the shore round fires, preparing their food, which they
took out of the provisions carried on the canoes. Only the water did
they obtain from the island, filling their coco-nut-made water vessels
from the springs. About a dozen canoes were actually moored at the
village beach. Late at night, I walked along the shore to observe their
sleeping arrangements. In the clear, moonlit night, the small fires
burnt with a red, subdued glow; there was always one of them between
each two sleepers, consisting of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385"
href="#pb385" name="pb385">385</a>]</span>three burning sticks,
gradually pushed in as they were consumed. The men slept with the big,
stiff pandanus mats over them; each mat is folded in the middle, and
when put on the ground, forms a kind of miniature prismatic tent. All
along the beach, it was almost a continuous row of man alternating with
fire, the dun-coloured mats being nearly invisible against the sand in
the full moonlight. It must have been a very light sleep for every now
and then, a man stirred, peeping up from under his shell, re-adjusting
the fire, and casting a searching glance over the surroundings. It
would be difficult to say whether mosquitoes or cold wind or fear of
sorcery disturbed their sleep most, but I should say the last.</p>
<p>The next morning, early, and without any warning, the whole fleet
sailed away. At about 8 o&rsquo;clock the last canoe punted towards the
offing, where they stepped their mast and hoisted their sail. There
were no farewell gifts, no conch shell blowing, and the Dobuans this
time left their resting place as they had come, without ceremony or
display. The morning after, the Nabwagetans followed them. I was left
in the village with a few cripples, the women and one or two men who
had remained perhaps to look after the village, perhaps specially to
keep watch over me and see that I did no mischief. Not one of them was
a good informant. Through a mistake of mine, I had missed the cutter
which had come two days before to the island of Gumasila and left
without me. With bad luck and bad weather, I might have had to wait a
few weeks, if not months in Nabwageta. I could perhaps have sailed in a
native canoe, but this could only be done without bedding, tent, or
even writing outfit and photographic apparatus, and so my travelling
would have been quite useless. It was a piece of great good luck that a
day or two afterwards, a motor launch, whose owner had heard about my
staying in the Amphletts, anchored in front of Nabwageta village, and
within an hour I was speeding towards the Trobriands again, following
the tracks of the Kula fleet.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the next morning, as we slowly made our way along
the channels in the opalescent, green lagoon, and as I watched a fleet
of small, local canoes fishing in their muddy waters, and could
recognise on the surrounding flat shores a dozen <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=
"pb386">386</a>]</span>well-known villages, my spirits rose, and I felt
well pleased to have left the picturesque, but ethnographically barren
Amphletts for the Trobriands, with their scores of excellent
informants.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Amphletts, in the persons of their male inhabitants
were soon to join me here. I went ashore in Sinaketa, where everybody
was full of the great moment which was soon to arrive. For the Dobuan
fleet was known to be coming, though on that morning, so far, no news
had reached them of its whereabouts. As a matter of fact, the Dobuans,
who had left Nabwageta forty-eight hours ahead of me, had made a slow
journey with light winds, and sailing a course to the East of mine, had
arrived that morning only in Vakuta.</p>
<p>All the rumours which had been reported to me in the Amphletts about
the previous movements of the Trobriand natives had been correct. Thus
the natives of Vakuta had really been to the East, to Kitava, and had
brought with them a big haul of armshells. To&rsquo;uluwa, the chief of
Kiriwina, had visited Kitava later, and about five or six days before
had returned from there, bringing with him 213 pairs of armshells. The
Sinaketans then had gone to Kiriwina, and out of the 213 pairs had
succeeded in securing 154. As there had been previously 150 pairs in
Sinaketa, a total of 304 was awaiting the Dobuans. On the morning of my
arrival, the Sinaketan party had just returned from Kiriwina, hurrying
home so as to have everything ready for the reception of the Dobuans.
Of these, we got the news that very afternoon&mdash;news which
travelled overland from one village to another, and reached us from
Vakuta with great rapidity. We were also told that the <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> fleet would be at Sinaketa within two or three
days.</p>
<p>This period I utilised in refurbishing my information about that
phase of the Kula, which I was going to witness, and trying to get a
clear outline of every detail of all that was going soon to happen. It
is extremely important in sociological work to know well beforehand the
underlying rules and the fundamental ideas of an occurrence, especially
if big masses of natives are concerned in it. Otherwise, the really
important events may be obliterated by quite irrelevant and accidental
movements of the crowd, and thus the significance of what he sees may
be lost to the observer. No doubt if one could repeat one&rsquo;s
observations on the same phenomenon over and over <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387" name=
"pb387">387</a>]</span>again, the essential and relevant features would
stand out by their regularity and permanence. If, however, as it often
happens in ethnographic field-work, one gets the opportunity only once
of witnessing a public ceremony, it is necessary to have its anatomy
well dissected beforehand, and then concentrate upon observing how
these outlines are followed up concretely, gauge the tone of the
general behaviour, the touches of emotion or passion, many small yet
significant details which nothing but actual observation can reveal,
and which throw much light upon the real, inner relation of the native
to his institution. So I was busy going over my old entries and
checking them and putting my material into shape in a detailed and
concrete manner.</p>
<p>On the third day, as I was sitting and taking notes in the
afternoon, word ran all round the villages that the Dobuan canoes had
been sighted. And indeed, as I hastened towards the shore, there could
be seen, far away, like small petals floating on the horizon, the sails
of the advancing fleet. I jumped at once into a canoe, and was punted
along towards the promontory of Kaykuyawa, about a mile to the South of
Sinaketa. There, one after the other, the Dobuan canoes were arriving,
dropping their sails and undoing the mast as they moored, until the
whole fleet, numbering now over eighty canoes, were assembled before me
(see <a href="#pl48">Plate XLVIII</a>). From each a few men waded
ashore, returning with big bunches of leaves. I saw them wash and smear
themselves and perform the successive stages of native, festive
adornment (see <a href="#pl49">Plate XLIX</a>). Each article was
medicated by some man or another in the canoe before it was used or put
on. The most carefully handled articles of ornamentation were the
ineffective looking, dried up herbs, taken out of their little
receptacles, where they had remained since they had been becharmed in
Dobu, and now stuck into the armlets. The whole thing went on quickly,
almost feverishly, making more the impression of a piece of technical
business being expeditiously performed, than of a solemn and elaborate
ceremony taking place. But the ceremonial element was soon to show
itself.</p>
<p>After the preparations were finished, the whole fleet formed itself
into a compact body, not quite regular, but with a certain order, about
four or five canoes being in a row, and one row behind the other. In
this formation they punted along over <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb388" href="#pb388" name="pb388">388</a>]</span>the Lagoon, too
shallow for paddling, towards the beach of Sinaketa. When they were
within about ten minutes of the shore, all the conch shells began to be
sounded, and the murmur of recited magic rose from the canoes. I could
not come sufficiently near the canoes, for reason of etiquette, to be
able to see the exact arrangement of the reciters, but I was told that
it was the same as that observed by the Trobrianders on their approach
to Dobu, described in <a href="#ch13">Chapter XIII</a>. The general
effect was powerful, when this wonderfully painted and fully decorated
fleet was gliding swiftly over the green waters of the Lagoon towards
the palm grove above the sand beach, at that moment thick with
expectant natives. But I imagine that the arrival of a Trobriand fleet
in Dobu must be considerably more effective even than that. The much
more picturesque landscape, the ceremonial paddling with the
leaf-shaped oars over the deep water, the higher sense of danger and
tension, than that which the Dobuans feel, when coming to visit the
meek Trobrianders, all this must make it even more dramatic and
impressive than the scene I have just described.</p>

<p class="first">Top picture: the Kula visitors and hosts sitting side
by side on a house platform in Sinaketa. Bottom picture: to the right
Tovasana, wearing a wig of pandanus fibre, holding his lime pot and
spatula and ornamented with <i lang="kij">buna</i> shell on his leg,
sits with Kauyaporu (on the left), the chief of the Dobuans, on the
platform of one of the Sinaketan chiefs. Note the aromatic herbs in
Kauyaporu&rsquo;s armlets.</p>
</div>
<p>Within some twenty metres from the shore, the canoes formed
themselves into a double row, the canoe of the <i lang=
"kij">toli&rsquo;uvalaku</i> on the left flank of the first row.
Kauyaporu, as soon as all the craft were in position, rose in his
canoe, and in a loud voice, addressed in Dobuan those standing on the
shore. His words, preserved in the memory of his hearers, were
transmitted to me that same evening in their Kiriwinian equivalent. He
spoke:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Who will be first in the Kula? The people of
Vakuta or yourselves? I deem you will have the lead! Bring armshells,
one basketful, two baskets; catch pigs; pluck coco-nuts; pluck
betel-nut! For this is my <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>. By and by, thou,
Kouta&rsquo;uya, wilt make an <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>, and we shall
give thee then plenty of <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>So spoke Kauyaporu, addressing his main partner, Kouta&rsquo;uya,
the second chief of Sinaketa. He did not address To&rsquo;udawada, the
most important chief, because he was not his main partner.</p>
<p>As soon as the speech was finished, Kouta&rsquo;uya waded through
the water from the beach, carrying a pair of armshells in each hand.
Behind him came a small boy, the youngest son, blowing a conch shell.
He was followed again by two men, who <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb389" href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>between them had a
stick resting on their shoulders, on which several pairs of <i lang=
"kij">mwali</i> (armshells) were displayed. This procession waded
towards the canoe of Kauyaporu, whom Kouta&rsquo;uya addressed in these
words, throwing the armshells on the platform of the canoe:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;This is a <i lang="kij">vaga</i> (opening
gift)! In due time, I shall make a <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> to Dobu;
thou shalt return to me a big <i lang="kij">soulava</i> (necklace) as
<i lang="kij">kudu</i> (equivalent gift) for this. Plenty more
armshells thou wilt receive now. There are plenty of armshells in
Sinaketa. We know there were plenty of armshells in Vakuta. By and by
thou and thy <i lang="kij">usagelu</i> come ashore, I shall catch a
pig. I shall give you plenty of food, coco-nuts, betel-nut, sugar cane,
bananas!&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as he was back on the shore, his wife, the eldest one, with
a <i lang="kij">peta</i> basket on her head, containing a pair of
armshells, went into the water and carried it to Kauyaporu&rsquo;s
canoe, the boy with the conch shell following her also. After that,
conch shells were blown on all sides on the shore, and single men or
groups detached themselves from the rest, and waded towards the canoes.
The <i lang="kij">mwali</i> were carried with ceremony on sticks or in
outstretched arm. But the grossly exaggerated way of putting one pair
of armshells into a basket which was big enough to hold some four
score, was only done by the chief&rsquo;s wife. All this lasted for
perhaps half-an-hour, while the setting sun poured down its glowing
light on the painted canoes, the yellow beach, and the lively bronze
forms moving upon it. Then, in a few moments, the Dobuan canoes were
partly beached, partly moored, whilst their crews spread over the seven
villages of Sinaketa. Large groups could be seen sitting on platforms
chewing <span class="corr" id="xd26e13447" title=
"Source: betel nut">betel-nut</span> and conversing in Dobuan with
their hosts (see <a href="#pl56">Plate LVI</a>).</p>
<p>For three days, the Dobuans remained in Sinaketa. Every now and
then, blasts of conch shell announced that a Kula transaction had taken
place, that is, that a pair of armshells had been handed over to one of
the visitors. Swarms of people from the other districts had assembled
in Sinaketa; every day, natives from the inland villages of Southern
Boyowa crowded into their capital, whilst people from Kuboma, Luba, and
Kiriwina, that is, the Central and Northern districts, were camping in
their relatives&rsquo; houses, in yam stores and under <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name=
"pb390">390</a>]</span>provisional shelters. Reckoning that the number
of the visitors, that is, the Dobuans, the Amphlettans and the
Vakutans, who had joined them on their way, amounted to some eight
hundred; that the Sinaketans numbered about five hundred people, and
that some twelve hundred had come from the other villages, it will be
seen that the crowd in and about Sinaketa was considerable, numbering
over two thousand.</p>
<p>The Trobriand natives, of course, looked after their own provisions.
The Dobuans had also brought a considerable amount of food with them,
and would receive some additional vegetables and pigs&rsquo; flesh from
their hosts, while they acquired fish from some of the other villages
of Boyowa. As a matter of fact, stingaree, shark and some other fish
are the only articles for which the Dobuans barter on their own
account. The rest of the trade, in the same way as is done in Dobu by
the Sinaketans, must be done with the community who receive visitors,
that is, with Sinaketa. The Sinaketans buy from the manufacturing
districts of Boyowa the same industrial products that they take with
them to Dobu, that is baskets, lime pots, lime spatul&aelig;, etc. Then
they sell these to the Dobuans in just the same manner and with the
same profit as was described in <a href="#ch15">Chapter XV</a>. As has
been said there also, a man of Sinaketa would never trade with his
partner, but with some other Dobuan. Between the partners, only
presents are exchanged. The gift offered by the Dobuans to the
Sinaketans is called <i lang="kij">vata&rsquo;i</i>, and it differs
only in name and not in its economic or sociological nature from the
<i lang="kij">pari</i> gift offered by the Boyowans to their overseas
partners. The <i lang="kij">talo&rsquo;i</i>, or farewell gift offered
to them is as a rule more substantial than the <i lang=
"kij">vata&rsquo;i</i>.</p>
<p>The Dobuans, during their stay in Sinaketa, lived on the beach or in
their canoes (see Plates <a href="#pl54">LIV</a> and <a href=
"#pl20">XX</a>). Skilfully rigged up with canopies of golden mats
covering parts of the craft, their painted hulls glowing in the sun
against the green water, some of the canoes presented the spectacle of
some gorgeously fantastic pleasure boat (see <a href="#pl55">Plate
LV</a>). The natives waded about amongst them, making the Lagoon lively
with movement, talk and laughter. Groups camped on the sea shore,
boiling food in the large clay pots, smoking and chewing betel-nut. Big
parties of Trobrianders walked among them, discreetly but curiously
watching them. Women were not very conspicuous in the whole
proceedings, nor did I hear <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href=
"#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span>any scandal about intrigues,
although such may have taken place.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On the fourth day, conch shells were blown again in
the morning, though on the last of the three days their sounds had
almost died out. These were the signs of the departure. Food and small
presents were brought to the canoes as <i lang="kij">talo&rsquo;i</i>,
and a few <i lang="kij">mwali</i> were given at the last, for which the
conch shells were blown. Without any ceremony or farewell speeches, the
Dobuan canoes sailed away, one after the other.</p>
<p>Their journey home was also interrupted by a customary halt for
fishing, but this time for fish, not shell. Some of them stop on the
beach of Muwa, but the bulk camp on a beach called Susuwa, half way
between Sinaketa and Vakuta, where they catch the fish by means of a
poisonous root, which they have brought for this purpose from home.
This time, they remained three days in Susuwa and Muwa, and then sailed
to Vakuta to receive there <i lang="kij">talo&rsquo;i</i>. Their
further journey I could not trace step by step, but afterwards I heard
that quickly, and without any accident, they had reached their
homes.</p>
<p>Their <i lang="kij">tanarere</i> on Sarubwoyna beach&mdash;that is,
the competitive display of the yield&mdash;gave more or less the
following results:</p>
<p>From Sinaketa they received 304 armshells.</p>
<p>From Vakuta they received 344 armshells.</p>
<p>The total therefore was 648. As there were about sixty canoes making
the proper <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> from Dobu, that is, not counting
those from the Amphletts and Vakuta which joined on the way and
appeared before Sinaketa, there were at the outside some five hundred
Dobuan natives on that expedition. Out of these, however, not more than
half were grown-up, Kula making men. So that, on the average, there
were nearly thirteen armshells for every five men. Some would not get
more than one pair, some perhaps even none, whilst the headmen received
large quantities.</p>
<p>We shall follow in a later chapter the movements of some at least of
those who had collected in Sinaketa from the other districts, in
connection with the Kula. It did not take them more than a few days to
disperse completely, and for the village to resume its ordinary aspect
and routine. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb392" href="#pb392" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In treating of the various customs and practices of
the Kula, I had at every step to enter into the description of magical
rites and into the analysis of spells. This had to be done, first of
all, because magic looms paramount in the natives&rsquo; view of the
Kula. Again, all magical formul&aelig; disclose essentials of belief
and illustrate typical ideas in a manner so thorough and telling that
no other road could lead us as straight into the inner mind of the
native. Finally, there is a direct, ethnographic interest in knowing
the details of magical performance, which has such an overweening
influence over tribal life, and enters so deeply into the make-up of
the natives&rsquo; mentality.</p>
<p>It is now necessary to complete our knowledge of magic and to focus
all the dispersed data into one coherent picture. So far, the many
scattered references and numerous concrete details have not furnished a
general idea, of what magic means to the natives; how they imagine the
working of the magical forces; what are their implied and expressed
views on the nature of magical power. Collecting all the material which
has already been presented in the previous chapters, and supplementing
it with native and ethnographic comments, we shall be able to arrive at
a certain synthesis, respecting the Kiriwinian theory of magic.</p>
<p>All the data which have been so far mustered disclose the extreme
importance of magic in the Kula. But if it were a question of treating
of any other aspect of the tribal life of these natives, it would also
be found that, whenever they approach any concern of vital importance,
they summon magic to their aid. It can be said without exaggeration
that magic, according to their ideas, governs human destinies; that it
supplies man with the power of mastering the forces of nature; and that
it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb393" href="#pb393" name=
"pb393">393</a>]</span>is his weapon and armour against the many
dangers which crowd in upon him on every side. Thus, in what is most
essential to man, that is in his health and bodily welfare, he is but a
plaything of the powers of sorcery, of evil spirits and of certain
beings, controlled by black magic. Death in almost all its forms is the
result of one of these agencies. Permanent ill-health and all kinds of
acute sickness, in fact everything, except such easily explainable
ailments as physical overstrain or slight colds, are attributed to
magic. I have spoken (<a href="#ch2">Chapter II</a>) of the several
ways in which the evil powers bring disease and death. The <i lang=
"kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i>, who bring epidemics and the <i lang=
"kij">tokway</i>, who inflict shooting pains and minor ailments, are
the only examples of non-human beings&rsquo; exerting any direct
influence on human destinies, and even the members of this restricted
pantheon of demonology only occasionally descend among the mortals to
put into action their potential powers. By far the deepest dread and
most constant concern of the natives are with the <i lang=
"kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i>, the entirely human sorcerers, who carry out
their work exclusively by means of magic. Second to them in the
quantity of magical output and in the frequency of their exploits, are
the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, the flying witches, which have been
described in detail in <a href="#ch11">Chapter XI</a>. They are a good
example of how every belief in a superior power is at the bottom a
belief in magic. Magic gives to these beings the capacity to destroy
human life and to command other agents of destruction. Magic also gives
man the power and the means to defend himself, and if properly applied,
to frustrate all the nefarious attempts of the <i lang=
"kij">mulukwausi</i>. Comparing the two agencies, it may be said that
in every-day life, the sorcerer is by far the most feared and is most
frequently believed to be at work; while the <i lang=
"kij">mulukwausi</i> enter upon the scene at certain dramatic moments,
such as the presence of death, a catastrophe on land, and more
especially at sea; but then, they enter with even deadlier weapons than
the <i lang="kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i>. Health, the normal state of human
beings can, if once lost, be regained by magic and by magic only. There
is no such thing as natural recovery, return to health being always due
to the removal of the evil magic by means of magical
counter-action.</p>
<p>All those crises of life, which are associated with fear of danger,
with the awakening of passions or of strong emotions, have also their
magical accompaniment. The birth of a child <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb394" href="#pb394" name="pb394">394</a>]</span>is
always ushered in by magic, in order to make the child prosper, and to
neutralise the dangers and evil influences. There is no rite or magic
at puberty; but then, with this people, puberty does not present any
very definite crisis in the life of the individual, as their sexual
life starts long before puberty arrives, and gradually shapes and
develops as the organism matures. The passion of love, however, has a
very elaborate magical counterpart, embodied in many rites and
formul&aelig;, to which a great importance is attached, and all success
in sexual life is ascribed to it. The evil results of illicit
love&mdash;that is love within the clan, which, by the way, is
considered by these natives as the main class of sexual
immorality&mdash;can also be counteracted by a special type of
magic.</p>
<p>The main social interests, ambition in gardening, ambition in
successful Kula, vanity and display of personal charms in
dancing&mdash;all find their expression in magic. There is a form of
beauty magic, performed ceremonially over the dancers, and there is
also a kind of safety magic at dances, whose object is to prevent the
evil magic of envious sorcerers. Particular garden magic, performed by
an individual over his crops and seeds, as well as the evil magic which
he casts on the gardens of his rivals, express the private ambitions in
gardening, as contrasted with the interests of the whole village, which
are catered for by communal garden magic.</p>
<p>Natural forces of great importance to man, such as rain and
sunshine, the appropriate alternative operation of which makes his
crops thrive; or wind, which must be controlled for purposes of sailing
and fishing, are also governed by magic. The magic of rain and sunshine
can be used for good, as well as for nefarious purposes, and in this
they have a special interest in the Trobriands, because the most
powerful system of this magic is in the hands of the paramount chiefs
of Kiriwina. By bringing about a prolonged drought, the chiefs of
Omarakana have always been able to express their general displeasure
with their subjects, and thus enhance their wholesale power,
independently of any other mechanism, which they might have used for
forcing their will on private individuals or on whole communities.</p>
<p>The basic, food-providing economic activities, which in the
Trobriands are mainly gardening and fishing, are also <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb395" href="#pb395" name=
"pb395">395</a>]</span>completely magic-ridden. The success of these
pursuits is of course largely due to luck, chance or accident, and to
the natives they require supernatural assistance. We had examples of
economic magic in describing the construction of a canoe, and the
fishing for <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> shell. The communal garden-magic
and the fishing magic of certain village communities show to a higher
degree even than the cases described, the feature which we found so
distinct in canoe magic, namely: that the rites and formul&aelig; are
not a mere appendage, running side by side with economic efforts,
without exercising any influence over these. On the contrary, it may be
said that a belief in magic is one of the main, psychological forces
which allow for organisation and systemisation of economic effort in
the Trobriands.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e13579src" href="#xd26e13579"
name="xd26e13579src">1</a> The capacity for art, as well as the
inspiration in it, is also ascribed to the influence of magic.</p>
<p>The passions of hatred, envy, and jealousy, besides finding their
expression in the all powerful sorcery of the <i lang=
"kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i> and <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, are also
responsible for many forms of witchery, known by the generic term of
<i lang="kij">bulubwalata</i>. The classical forms of this magic have
as their object the estrangement of the affections of a wife or a
sweetheart, or the destruction of the domestic attachment of a pig. The
pig is sent away into the bush, having been made to take a dislike to
its master and to its domestic habits; the wife, though the spells used
to estrange her are slightly different, can be made also to take a
dislike to her domestic life, abandon her husband and return to her
parents. There is a <i lang="kij">bulubwalata</i> of gardens, of
canoes, of Kula, of <i lang="kij">kaloma</i>, in fact of everything,
and a good deal of beneficial magic is taken up with exorcising the
results of <i lang="kij">bulubwalata</i>.</p>
<p>The list of magic is not quite exhausted yet. There is the magic of
conditional curses, performed in order to guard property from possible
harm, inflicted by others; there is war-magic; there is magic
associated with taboos put on coco-nuts and betel-nuts, in order to
make them grow and multiply; there is magic to avert thunder and
resuscitate people who are struck by lightning; there is the magic of
tooth-ache, and a magic to make food last a long time.</p>
<p>All this shows the wide diffusion of magic, its extreme importance
and also the fact that it is always strongest there, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb396" href="#pb396" name=
"pb396">396</a>]</span>where vital interests are concerned; where
violent passions or emotions are awakened; when mysterious forces are
opposed to man&rsquo;s endeavours; and when he has to recognise that
there is something which eludes his most careful calculations, his most
conscientious preparations and efforts.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us now proceed to formulate some short statement
of the essential conception of magic, as it is entertained by the
natives. All statement of belief, found among human beings so widely
different from us, is full of difficulties and pitfalls, which perhaps
beset us most there, where we try to arrive at the very foundation of
the belief&mdash;that is, at the most general ideas which underlie a
series of practices and a body of traditions. In dealing with a native
community at the stage of development which we find in the Trobriands,
we cannot expect to obtain a definite, precise and abstract statement
from a philosopher, belonging to the community itself. The native takes
his fundamental assumptions for granted, and if he reasons or inquires
into matters of belief, it would be always only as regards details and
concrete applications. Any attempts on the part of the Ethnographer to
induce his informant to formulate such a general statement would have
to be in the form of leading questions of the worst type because in
these leading questions he would have to introduce words and concepts
essentially foreign to the native. Once the informant grasped their
meaning, his outlook would be warped by our own ideas having been
poured into it. Thus the Ethnographer must draw the generalisation for
himself, must formulate the abstract statement without the direct help
of a native informant.</p>
<p>I am saying <i>direct help</i> because the generalisation must be
entirely based on indirect data supplied by the natives. In the course
of collecting information, of discussing formul&aelig; and translating
their text, a considerable number of opinions on matters of detail will
be set forth by the natives. Such spontaneous opinions, if placed in a
correctly constructed mosaic, might almost of themselves give us a true
picture, might almost cover the whole field of native belief. And then
our task would only be to summarise this picture in an abstract
formula. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb397" href="#pb397" name=
"pb397">397</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Ethnographer, however, possesses an even better supply of
evidence from which to draw his conclusions. The objective items of
culture, into which belief has crystallised in the form of tradition,
myth, spell and rite are the most important source of knowledge. In
them, we can face the same realities of belief as the native faces in
his intimate intercourse with the magical, the same realities which he
not only professes with his tongue, but lives through partly in
imagination and partly in actual experience. An analysis of the
contents of the spells, the study of the manner in which they are
uttered; in which the concomitant rites are performed; the study of the
natives&rsquo; behaviour, of the actors as well as of the spectators;
the knowledge of the social position and social functions, of the
magical expert&mdash;all this reveals to us, not only the bare
structure of their ideas on magic, but also the associated sentiments
and emotions, and the nature of magic as a social force.</p>
<p>An Ethnographer who, from the study of such objective data, has been
able to penetrate into the natives&rsquo; attitude, to formulate a
general theory of magic, can <i>then</i> test his conclusions by direct
questionings. For he will be already in a position to use native
terminology and to move along the lines of native thought, and in his
questionings he will be able to accept the lead of his informant
instead of misleading the latter and himself by leading questions. More
especially in obtaining opinions of actual occurrences from the
natives, he will not have to move in abstract generalities, but will be
able to translate them into concrete applications and into the native
modes of thought.</p>
<p>In arriving at such general conclusions about vast aspects of
primitive human thought and custom, the Ethnographer&rsquo;s is a
creative work, in so far as he brings to light phenomena of human
nature which, in their entirety, had remained hidden even from those in
whom they happened. It is creative in the same sense as is the
construction of general principles of natural science, where objective
laws of very wide application lie hidden till brought forth by the
investigating human mind. In the same sense, however, as the principles
of natural science are empirical, so are also the final generalisations
of ethnographic sociology because, though expressly stated for the
first time by the investigator, they are none the less objective
realities of human thinking, feeling and behaviour. <span class=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">III</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We can start from the question of how the natives
imagine their magic to have originated. If we would ask even the most
intelligent informant some such concretely framed questions as:
&ldquo;Where has your magic been made? How do you imagine its
invention?&rdquo;&mdash;they would necessarily remain unanswered. Not
even a warped and half-suggested reply would be forthcoming. Yet there
is an answer to this question, or rather to its generalised equivalent.
Examining the mythology of one form of magic after the other, we find
that there are in every one either explicitly stated or implied views
about how magic has become known to man. As we register these views,
compare them, and arrive at a generalisation, we easily see, why our
imaginary question, put to the natives, would have to remain
unanswered. For, according to native belief, embedded in all traditions
and all institutions, magic is never conceived as having been made or
invented. Magic has been handed on as a thing which has always been
there. It is conceived as an intrinsic ingredient of everything that
vitally affects man. The words, by which a magician exercises his power
over a thing or a process, are believed to be co-existent with them.
The magical formula and its subject matter were born together.</p>
<p>In some cases, tradition represents them literally as being
&lsquo;born&rsquo; by the same woman. Thus, rain was brought forth by a
woman of Kasana&rsquo;i, and the magic came with it, and has been
handed on ever since in this woman&rsquo;s sub-clan. Again, the
mythical mother of the Kultur-hero Tudava gave birth, among other
plants and animals, also to the <i lang="kij">kalala</i> fish. The
magic of this fish is also due to her. In the short myth about the
origin of <i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> magic&mdash;the one to
protect drowning sailors from witches and other dangers&mdash;we saw
that the mother, who gave birth to the Tokulubweydoga dog, also handed
the magic over to him. In all these cases, however, the myth does not
point to these women&rsquo;s inventing or composing the magic; indeed,
it is explicitly stated by some natives that the women had learned the
magic from their matrilineal ancestors. In the last case, the woman is
said in the myth to have known the magic by tradition.</p>
<p>Other myths are more rudimentary, yet, though less circumstantial
about the origin of the magic, show us just as <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span>unmistakably that magic is a primeval thing,
indeed, in the literal sense of the word, autochthonous. Thus, the Kula
magic in Gumasila came out of the rock of Selawaya; the canoe magic out
of the hole in the ground, brought by the men, who originally emerged
with it; garden magic is always conceived as being carried from
underground by the first ancestors, who emerged out of the original
hole of that locality. Several minor forms of magic of local currency,
such as fish magic, practised in one village only, wind magic, etc.,
are also imagined to have been carried out of the ground. All the forms
of sorcery have been handed over to people by non-human beings, who
passed them on but did not create them. The <i lang=
"kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i> sorcery is due to a crab, who gave it to a
mythical personage, in whose <i lang="kij">dala</i> (sub-clan) the
magic was carried on and from it distributed all over the islands. The
<i lang="kij">tokway</i> (wood-sprites) have taught man certain forms
of evil magic. There are no myths in Kiriwina about the origin of
flying witch magic. From other districts, however, I have obtained
rudimentary information pointing to the fact that they were instructed
in this magic by a mythical, malevolent being called Taukuripokapoka,
with whom even now some sort of relations are kept up, culminating in
nocturnal meetings and sexual orgies which remind one very strongly of
the Walpurgisnacht.</p>
<p>Love magic, the magic of thunder and lightning, are accounted for by
definite events. But in neither of them are we led to imagine that the
formula is invented, in fact, there is a sort of <i lang="la">petitio
principii</i> in all these myths, for on the one hand they set out to
account for how magic came, and on the other, in all of them magic is
represented as being there, ready made. But the <i lang="la">petitio
principii</i> is due only to a false attitude of mind with which we
approach these tales. Because, to the native mind, they set out to
tell, not how magic originated, but how magic was brought within the
reach of one or other of the Boyowan local groups or sub-clans.</p>
<p>Thus it may be said, in formulating a generalisation from all these
data, that magic is never invented. In olden days, when mythical things
happened, magic came from underground, or was given to a man by some
non-human being, or was handed on to descendants by the original
ancestress, who also brought forth the phenomenon governed by the
magic. In actual cases of the present times and of the near-past
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb400" href="#pb400" name=
"pb400">400</a>]</span>generations whom the natives of to-day knew
personally, the magic is given by one man to another, as a rule by the
father to his son or by the maternal kinsman. But its very essence is
the impossibility of its being manufactured or invented by man, its
complete resistance to any change or modification by him. It has
existed ever since the beginning of things; it creates, but is never
created; it modifies, but must never be modified.</p>
<p>It is now easy to see that no questions about the origins of magic,
such as we formulated before, could have been asked of a native
informant without distorting the evidence in the very act of
questioning, while more general and quite abstract and colourless
inquiries cannot be made intelligible to him. He has grown up into a
world where certain processes, certain activities have their magic,
which is as much an attribute of theirs&rsquo; as anything else. Some
people have been traditionally instructed how this magic runs, and they
know it; how men came by magic is told in numerous mythical narratives.
That is the correct statement of the native point of view. Once arrived
at this conclusion inductively, we can of course, test our conclusions
by direct questions, or by a leading question, for the matter of that.
To the question: &ldquo;where human beings found magic?&rdquo; I
obtained the following answer:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;All magic, they found long ago in the nether
world. We do not find ever a spell in a dream; should we say so, this
would be a lie. The spirits never give us a spell. Songs and dances
they do give us, that is true, but no magic.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This statement, expressing the belief in a very clear and direct
manner, I had confirmed, reiterated with variations and amplifications,
by ever so many informants. They all emphasise the fact that magic has
its roots in tradition, that it is the most immutable and most valuable
traditional item, that it cannot leak into human knowledge by any
present human intercourse with spirits or with any non-human beings
such as the <i lang="kij">tokway</i> or <i lang=
"kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i>. The property of having been received from
previous generations is so marked that any breach of continuity in this
succession cannot be imagined, and any addition by an actual human
being would make the magic spurious.</p>
<p>At the same time, magic is conceived as something essentially human.
It is not a force of nature, captured by man <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb401" href="#pb401" name=
"pb401">401</a>]</span>through some means and put to his service; it is
essentially the assertion of man&rsquo;s intrinsic power over nature.
In saying that, I, of course translate native belief into abstract
terms, which they would not use themselves for its expression. None the
less it is embodied in all their items of folk-lore and ways of using
magic and thinking about it. In all the traditions, we find that magic
is always in possession of man, or at least of anthropomorphic beings.
It is carried out from underground by man. It is not conceived as
having been there somewhere outside his knowledge and then captured. On
the contrary, as we saw, often the very things which are governed by
magic have been brought forth by man, as for instance rain, the
<i lang="kij">kalala</i> fish; or disease, created by the <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e13695" title=
"Source: anthropmorphic">anthropomorphic</span> crab.</p>
<p>The close sociological association of magic with a given sub-clan
emphasises this anthropocentric conception of magic. In the majority of
cases indeed, magic refers to human activities or to the response of
nature to human activities, rather than to natural forces alone. Thus,
in gardening and in fishing, it is the behaviour of plants and animals
tended or pursued by man; in the canoe magic, in the carver&rsquo;s
magic, the object is a human-made thing; in the Kula, in love magic, in
many forms of food magic, it is human nature on to which the force is
directed. Disease is not conceived as an extraneous force, coming from
outside and settling on the man, it is directly a man-made,
sorcerer-made something. We may, therefore, amplify the above given
definition, and say that magic is a traditionally handed on power of
man over his own creations, over things once brought forth by man, or
over responses of nature to his activities.</p>
<p>There is one more important aspect of the question of which I have
spoken already&mdash;the relation of magic to myth. It has been stated
in <a href="#ch12">Chapter XII</a>, that myth moves in the realm of the
supernatural, or better, super-normal, and that magic bridges over the
gap between that and present-day reality. Now this statement acquires a
new importance; magic appears to us as the essence of traditional
continuity with ancestral times. Not only, as I have emphasised in this
chapter, is it never conceived as a new invention, but it is identical
in its nature with the supernatural power which forms the atmosphere of
mythical events. Some of this power may have been lost on its way down
to our times&mdash;mythical stories relate how it <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb402" href="#pb402" name="pb402">402</a>]</span>has
been lost; but never has anything been added to it. There is nothing in
it now which has not been in it in the ancient, hoary times of myth. In
this the natives have a definitely regressive view of the relation
between now and before; in this they have their counterpart to a Golden
Age, and to a Garden of Eden of sorts. Thus we fall back upon the
recognition of the same truth, whether we approach the matter by
looking for beginnings of magic, or by studying the relations between
the present and the mythical reality. Magic is a thing never invented
and never tampered with, by man or any other agency.</p>
<p>This, of course, means that it is so in native belief. It hardly
needs explicitly stating that in reality magic must constantly change.
The memory of men is not such, that it could hand over verbally exactly
what it had received, and, like any other item of traditional lore, a
magical formula is in reality constantly being re-shaped as it passes
from one generation to another, and even within the mind of the same
man. As a matter of fact, even from the material collected by me in the
Trobriands, it can be unmistakably recognised that certain
formul&aelig; are much older than others, and indeed, that some parts
of spells, and even some whole spells, are of recent invention. Here I
cannot do more than refer to this interesting subject, which, for its
full development, needs a good deal of linguistic analysis, as well as
of other forms of &ldquo;higher criticism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All these considerations have brought us very near to the essential
problem: what does magic really mean to the natives? So far, we have
seen that it is an inherent power of man over those things which
vitally affect him, a power always handed over through
tradition.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e13712src" href="#xd26e13712"
name="xd26e13712src">2</a> About the beginnings of magic they know as
little, and are occupied as little as about the beginnings of the
world. Their myths describe the origin of <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb403" href="#pb403" name="pb403">403</a>]</span>social institutions
and the peopling of the world by men. But the world is taken for

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So far we have not gone beyond the examination of
myths and of what we can learn from them about the nature of magic. To
gain a deeper insight into this subject, we must study more closely the
concrete data about magical performance. Even in the foregoing chapters
a sufficient material has been collected to allow of correct
inferences, and I shall only here and there have to allude to other
forms of magic, besides that of canoe, Kula and sailing.</p>
<p>I have spoken so far about &ldquo;magic&rdquo; in a wholesale
manner, as if it were all of one piece. As a matter of fact, magic all
the world over, however rudimentary or developed it might be, presents
three essential aspects. In its performance there enter always some
words spoken or chanted, some actions carried out, and there are always
the minister or ministers of the ceremony. In analysing the concrete
details of magical performances, therefore, we have to distinguish the
<i>formula, the rite</i>, and <i>the condition of the
performer</i>.</p>
<p>These three factors stand out quite clearly and definitely in the
Trobriand magic, whether we examine the facts themselves or the
natives&rsquo; way of looking at them. It may be said at once that in
this society the relative importance of the three factors is not quite
the same. The spell is by far the most important constituent of magic.
In their linguistic use, although these natives have a special word,
<i lang="kij">yopa</i>, they very often use the word magic, <i lang=
"kij">megwa</i>, to describe a spell. The spell is the part of the
magic which is kept secret and known only to the esoteric circle of
practitioners. When a magic is handed over, whether by purchase, gift,
or inheritance, only the spell has to be taught to the new recipient,
and as already once said before, it is usually taught in instalments,
while the payment is received in that manner. When one speaks about
magical knowledge, or in inquiries whether an individual knows some
magic, this invariably refers to the formula, for the nature of the
rite is always quite public property. Even from the examples given in
this book, it can be seen how simple are the rites and how elaborate
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb404" href="#pb404" name=
"pb404">404</a>]</span>often the formul&aelig;. To direct questions on
the subject, the natives always reply that the spell is the more
important part. The question: &ldquo;where is the real strength of
magic?&rdquo; would receive the reply: &ldquo;in the spell.&rdquo; The
condition of the magician is, like the rite, essential to the
performance of the magic, but it also is considered by the natives as
subservient to the spell.</p>
<p>All this must be made clearer by the examination of actual facts.
First of all, let us examine the relation between spell and rite; and
to this purpose it will be best to group the various magical
performances into several classes according to the complexity of the
concomitant rite. We shall begin with the simplest rites.</p>
<p><i>Spells uttered directly without concomitant rite</i>.&mdash;We
had one or two examples of such magic where the performer simply utters
a formula directly into space. For example, the communal magician of
the <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> (spondylus shell) fishing performs the
first act by walking on the beach and reciting his spell towards the
sea. In the moment of actual shipwreck, before abandoning the canoe,
the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> launches his last <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> directly into the elements. Again, he lets his
voice float over the waters, when invoking the marvellous fish, who
will bring the drowning party to some friendly shore. The final spell
of the Kula, by which the approaching canoe &lsquo;shakes the
mountain,&rsquo; chanted by a trio of magical reciters, is thrown
directly towards the Koya. The clearing of the sea in the <i lang=
"kij">kaloma</i> fishing is also done this way, and many more examples
could be adduced from garden magic, wind magic, and other classes not
described in this book.</p>
<p>The natives have a special expression for such acts; they say that
the formula is recited &lsquo;by the mouth only,&rsquo; &lsquo;<i lang=
"kij">o wadola wala</i>.&rsquo; This form of magic with such a
rudimentary rite is, however, relatively uncommon. Although one could
say that there is no rite at all in such cases, for the magician does
not manipulate anything or perform any action beyond speaking, yet from
another point of view, the whole performance is ritual in so far as he
has always to cast his voice towards the element, or being, which he
addresses. Indeed here, as in all other cases, the voice of the reciter
has to be somehow or other conveyed to the object which he wishes to
becharm. We see, moreover, that in all these instances, the nature of
this object is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb405" href="#pb405" name=
"pb405">405</a>]</span>such that it can be directly reached by the
voice, whilst on the other hand, there would be some difficulty in
applying any substance or performing any action over, let us say, wind,
or a shell growing on a distant reef or the Koya (mountain).</p>
<p><i>Spells accompanied by simple rites of impregnation</i>.&mdash;A
large number of the cases described in this book falls under this
heading. We saw quite at the beginning (<a href="#div5.2">Chapter V,
Division II and III</a>) how the magician charms the blade of his adze,
the ropes by which the canoe had been pulled, the lashing creeper, the
caulking, and the paint of the canoe. Among the Kula rites, the initial
magic over the aromatic mint, over the <i lang="kij">lilava</i>
(magical bundle) over the <i lang="kij">gebobo</i> (central part of
canoe); all the beauty magic on Sarubwoyna beach, over coco-nuts, over
the facial paints as well as the conch shell magic, belong here. In all
these performances an object is put well within reach of the voice, and
in an appropriate position. Often, the object is placed within a
receptacle or covering so that the voice enters an enclosed space and
is concentrated upon the substance to be charmed. Thus, when the
<i lang="kij">lilava</i> is chanted over, the voice is cast into the
mats, which are afterwards carefully wrapped up. The aromatic mint is
charmed, lying at the bottom of a bag made of baked and thus toughened
banana leaf, which afterwards is carefully folded together and bound
with string. Again, the adze blade is first of all half wrapped up in a
banana leaf, and the voice enters the blade and the inside of the leaf,
which subsequently is folded over and tied over the blade. In the magic
of the conch shell, I drew attention to the fact that immediately after
the charm has been spoken, both holes of the instrument are carefully
stuffed up. In all cases where an object is going to be used
immediately, not so many precautions are taken, but always, without any
exception, the mouth is put quite close to the object medicated (see
<a href="#pl57">Plate LVII</a>) and wherever possible, this latter is
placed in some sort of cavity, such as a folded piece of leaf, or even
the two palms of the hand put together. All this shows that it is
essential to a correct performance of magic, that the voice should be
conveyed directly to the substance, if possible enclosed and condensed
round it, and then, imprisoned permanently there by means of some
wrapping. Thus, in this type of rite, the action serves mainly to
convey carefully and to retain the spell round the object. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb406" href="#pb406" name="pb406">406</a>]</span></p>
<p>It may be noted that in almost all cases described, the substance
harmed in the rite is not the final aim of the magic, but forms only a
constituent part of the object in view or is an accessory of it, or an
instrument used in its making. Thus the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i>
creeper, the <i lang="kij">kaybasi</i> (caulking), the paint, the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e13803" title=
"Source: prowboards">prow-boards</span>, all these are constituent
parts of the canoe, and the magic performed over them does not aim at
giving them any qualities, but aims at imparting swiftness and
lightness to the canoe of which they are parts only. Again, the herbs
and the colours of the coco-nut ointment medicated in the Kula are
accessories of the final end of this magic, that is, of the personal
beauty and attractiveness of the performer. The adze, the breaking
stone in <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> magic are implements used in
obtaining the object, towards which the magic is directed. There are
only a few instances in which the simple rite of impregnation is
directly performed on the object in view. If we compare this type of
rite with the one of the previous category, we see that the difference
lies mainly in the size of the object. If you want to cast a charm over
a mountain, over a reef, or over the wind, you cannot put your object
into a little bag made of banana leaf. Nor can you put there the human
mind. And as a rule, the final objects of magical rites are not small
things, which could be easily handled. In the magic described in this
book, there is, I think, not one single instance, in which the
substance handled in the rite and impregnated by condensing the charm
upon it artificially, is the final object of the spell. In war magic
the points of the spears are made effective and the shields are made
spear-proof (see <a href="#pl58">Plate LVIII</a>) by magic uttered over
them. In private garden magic, the planted yams are made fruitful by a
spell, and a few more examples could be adduced from other types of
magic.</p>

</div>
<p><i>Spells accompanied by a rite of transference</i>.&mdash;When we
compare the rite of medicating the adze blade with the rite of
medicating some dried grass, with which the canoe is afterwards beaten,
we see that, in the second case, the magic is uttered over a something,
which has no intrinsic connection with the final object of the magic,
that is, with the canoe. It is neither to become a part of it, nor to
be used as an implement in its manufacture. We have here the
introduction for purposes of the rite, of a special medium, used to
absorb the magical force, and to transfer it to the final object. We
can therefore call <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb407" href="#pb407"
name="pb407">407</a>]</span>rites where such mediums are used <i>rites
of transference</i>. When a stick is charmed to be used afterwards for
the magical knocking out of a canoe; or a mussel-shell, with which the
canoe will be scraped; or a piece of coco-nut husk, which will be
thrown into the water to remove the heaviness of the canoe; or a
pandanus streamer, which will give it swiftness, there is introduced
into every one of these rites a substance which has to play a magical
r&ocirc;le only. The rite, therefore, is not the simple charming of a
part or of a constructive implement, which will enter into the
composition or be used in the making of an object. The rite here is
more autonomous, possesses more of its own significance. The beating of
a canoe with two bunches of grass, one after the other, in order first
to extract its heaviness and then impart to it lightness, has a meaning
parallel to the spell but independent of it. So has also the throwing
down of the coco-nut husk. The flutter of the pandanus streamers has
direct association with speed, as the natives explicitly state. As the
<i lang="kij">bisila</i> streamers flutter in the wind, so should the
canoe and the sail shake with the swiftness of their going. In the case
of the ginger, which is spat over the Dobuans feigning hostility, the
inherent quality of the substance, which our pharmacop&aelig;as
describe as a <i>stimulant</i>, makes the meaning of the rite plain. We
can easily see that some of the rites are rather more creative than
others. That is, the very act performed produces, according to native
ideas, a more definite effect than in others. So it is with the
spitting of the ginger, and still more directly the spilling of the
lime, in order to produce a mist, and shut the eyes of the <i lang=
"kij">mulukwausi</i>. These two, for instance, are more creative than
the hanging up of the pandanus streamer.</p>
<p><i>Spells accompanied by offerings and invocations</i>.&mdash;In the
very first rite described in this book, we saw an offering being laid
before, and an invocation being addressed to the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e13874" title="Source: wood sprite">wood-sprite</span>, <i lang=
"kij">tokway</i>. There are a number of rites, accompanied by offerings
given to ancestral spirits, whose participation in the offering is
solicited. Such rites are performed in garden magic (see <a href=
"#pl59">Plate LIX</a>) in fishing magic, and in weather magic. It must,
however, be said at once that there is no worship and no sacrificial
offering involved in these rites, that is, not of the usual
description, because the spirits are not imagined to serve as agents of
the magician, in carrying out the bidding of his <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name=
"pb408">408</a>]</span>magic. We shall return to the subject presently.
Here it will be enough to notice that the only instance of such a spell
we have come across&mdash;that is, the invocation of the <i lang=
"kij">tokway</i>&mdash;has its concomitant offering made only as a sort
of compensation for having chased him out, or as a means of persuading
him to go. Probably it is the first rather than the second, because the
<i lang="kij">tokway</i> has no free choice left, after he has been
exorcised. He must obey the bidding of the magician.</p>
<p>This survey shows clearly that the virtue, the force, the effective
principle of magic lies in the spell. We saw that in many cases, the
spell is quite sufficient, if directly breathed upon the object. Again,
in what may be called the prevalent type of ritual, the action which
accompanies the utterance of the formula serves only to direct and
condense the spell upon the object. In all such cases the rite lacks
all independent significance, all autonomous function. In some cases,
the rite introduces a substance which is used for magical purposes
only. As a rule, the substance then intensifies, through a parallel
action, the meaning of the spell. On the whole, it may be said that the
main creative power of magic resides in the formula; that the rite
serves to convey, or transfer it to the object, in certain cases
emphasising the meaning of the spell through the nature of the
transferring medium, as well as through the manner in which it is
finally applied. It is hardly necessary to state that in the Trobriand
magic, there are no rites performed without the spell.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is also evident in studying the manner in which the
force of the spell is conveyed to the object, that the voice of the
reciter transfers the virtue. Indeed, as has been repeatedly pointed
out, in quoting the formul&aelig;, and as we shall have to discuss
later still, the magical words are, so to speak, rubbed in by constant
repetition to the substance. To understand this better we must inquire
into the natives&rsquo; conceptions of psycho-physiology. The mind,
<i lang="kij">nanola</i>, by which term intelligence, power of
discrimination, capacity for learning magical formul&aelig;, and all
forms of non-manual skill are described, as well as moral qualities,
resides somewhere in the larynx. The natives will always point to the
organs of speech, where the <i lang="kij">nanola</i> resides. The man
who cannot speak through any defect <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb409" href="#pb409" name="pb409">409</a>]</span>of his organs, is
identified in name (<i lang="kij">tonagowa</i>) and in treatment with
all those mentally deficient. The memory, however, the store of
formul&aelig; and traditions learned by heart, resides deeper, in the
belly. A man will be said to have a good <i lang="kij">nanola</i>, when
he can acquire many formul&aelig;, but though they enter through the
larynx, naturally, as he learns them, repeating word for word, he has
to stow them away in a bigger and more commodious receptacle; they sink
down right to the bottom of his abdomen. I made the discovery of this
anatomical truth, while collecting war magic, from Kanukubusi, the last
office holder of the long succession of war magicians to the chiefs of
Omarakana. Kanukubusi is an old man, with a big head, a broad, high
forehead, a stumpy nose, and no chin, the meekest and most docile of my
informants, with a permanently puzzled and frightened expression on his
honest countenance (see <a href="#pl58">Plate LVIII</a>). I found this
mild old man very trustworthy and accurate, an excellent informant
indeed, within the narrow sphere of his speciality, which he and his
predecessors had used to make &lsquo;anger flare up in the <i lang=
"kij">nanola</i>&rsquo; of Omarakana men, to make the enemy fly in
terror, pursued and slaughtered by the victorious warriors. I paid him
well for the few formul&aelig; he gave me, and inquired at the end of
our first session, whether he had any more magic to produce. With
pride, he struck his belly several times, and answered: &ldquo;Plenty
more lies there!&rdquo; I at once checked his statement by an
independent informant, and learned that everybody carries his magic in
his abdomen.</p>
<p>There exist also certain ideas about stratification of magic,
namely, that certain forms of magic have to be learnt first, so that
they sink down, while others come on top. But these ideas are vague and
contradictory, whereas the main idea, that magic rests in the belly, is
clear and definite. This fact gives us a new insight into native ideas
about magic. The force of magic, crystallised in the magical
formul&aelig;, is carried by men of the present generation in their
bodies. They are the depositories of this most valuable legacy of the
past. The force of magic does not reside in the things; it resides
within man and can escape only through his voice.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">So far, we only spoke of the relation between spell
and rite. The last point, however, brings us to the problem of the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb410" href="#pb410" name=
"pb410">410</a>]</span>condition of the performer. His belly is a
tabernacle of magical force. Such a privilege carries its dangers and
obligations. It is clear that you cannot stuff foreign matter
indiscriminately into a place, where extremely valuable possessions are
kept. Food restrictions, therefore, become imperative. Many of them are
directly determined by the contents of the spell. We saw some examples
of this, as when red fish, invoked in magic, is tabooed to the
performer; or the dog, spoken about in the Ka&rsquo;ubanai spell, may
not be heard howling while the man eats. In other cases, the object
which is the aim of the magic, cannot be partaken by the magician. This
is the rule in the case of shark fishing, <i lang="kij">kalala</i>
fishing, and other forms of fishing magic. The garden magician is also
debarred from partaking of new crops, up to a certain period. There is
hardly any clear doctrine, as to why things mentioned in magical
formul&aelig;, whether they are the aims of the magic or only
cooperating factors, should not be eaten. There is just the general
apprehension that the formula would be damaged by it. There are other
taboos, binding the magician, some of them permanent, some of them
temporary, during the season of his magical performance. We saw some
permanent ones, as in the case of the man who knows Kayga&rsquo;u
magic, and is not allowed to eat while children make noises. The
temporary ones, such as the sexual abstinence during the first rites of
the Kula, could be supplemented by numerous examples from other forms
of magic. Thus, in order to bring about rain, the magician paints
himself black and has to remain unwashed and unkempt for some time. The
shark magician has to keep his house open, to remove his pubic leaf and
to sit with his legs apart, while the fishing and the magic last,
&ldquo;so that the shark&rsquo;s mouth might remain gaping.&rdquo; But
we cannot enter too much into enumeration of these taboos and
observances, and have only to make it clear that the proper behaviour
of the magician is one of the essentials of magic, and that in many
cases this behaviour is dictated by the contents of the spell.</p>
<p>The taboos and observances are not the only conditions which a man
must fulfil in order to carry out certain forms of magic. In many cases
the most important condition is his membership in a social group, for
many forms of magic are strictly local, and must be performed by one,
who is the descendant of the mythical, original owner of the magic.
Thus in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb411" href="#pb411" name=
"pb411">411</a>]</span>every case of garden magic, a magic which to the
natives ranks first among all the other types of beneficent magic, the
performer must be genealogically related to the first ancestor, who
locally emerged from the hole. Certain exceptions to this rule are to
be found only in cases where a family of high rank has come and usurped
the headmanship of the group, but these exceptions are rare. In the
case of the several systems of local fishing magic, the office of
magician is hereditary, and associated with the locality. The important
rain and sun magic which have been &lsquo;born&rsquo; in
Kasana&rsquo;i, can only be performed by the chiefs of that spot, who
have <span class="corr" id="xd26e13936" title=
"Source: ursurped">usurped</span> this important privilege from the
original local headman. The succession, is of course, always
matrilineal. A man may make a gift of such a magic to his son, but this
latter may be obliged to relinquish the privilege at his father&rsquo;s
death, and he never will be allowed to hand it over to his son, unless
this latter belongs again to the local group, through cross-cousin
marriage. Even in transactions where magic is sold or given away from
one clan to another, the prestige of certain local groups as main
specialists and experts in a branch of magic still remain. For
instance, the black magic, though practised all over the place and no
more localised, is still believed to be best known in the villages of
Ba&rsquo;u and Bwoytalu, where the original crab fell down from the
skies, and brought with him the magic. The Kula magic is also spread
over the whole district, yet it is still associated with definite
localities.</p>
<p>To summarise these sociological observations, We may say that, where
the local character of magic is still maintained, the magician has to
belong to the <i lang="kij">dala</i> (sub-clan or local group) of the
mythical ancestor. In all other cases, the local character of magic is
still recognised, even though it does not influence the sociology of
the magician.</p>
<p>The traditional character of magic and the magical filiation of the
performer find their expression in another important feature of the
spells. In some of them, as we have seen, references to mythical events
are made, or names of mythical ancestors are uttered. Even more often,
we find a whole list of names, beginning with the mythical founder of
the magic, and ending with the name of the immediate predecessor, that
is, of the man from whom the magic was obtained by the actual
performer. Such a list links up the present magician by a sort
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb412" href="#pb412" name=
"pb412">412</a>]</span>of magical pedigree with all those, who had
previously been using this formula. In other formul&aelig; again, the
magician identifies himself with some mythical individual, and utters
the latter&rsquo;s name in the first person. Thus, in the spell uttered
whilst plucking the mint plant, we found the phrase: &ldquo;I,
Kwoyregu, with my father, we cut the <i lang="kij">sulumwoya</i> of
Laba&rsquo;i.&rdquo; Both the actual genealogical descent of the
magician from the mythical ancestors, and the magical filiation
expressed in the formul&aelig; show again the paramount importance of
tradition, in this case acting on the sociological determination of the
performer. He is placed in a definite social group of those, who by
birth, or what could be called &lsquo;magical adoption&rsquo;, have had
the right of performing this magic. In the very act of uttering the
spell, the magician bears testimony to his indebtedness to the past by
the enumeration of magical names, and by references to myth and
mythical events. Both the sociological restrictions, wherever they
still exist, and the magical filiation confirm once more the dependence
of magic on tradition. On the other hand, both show, as also do the
taboos, that the obligations imposed on the magician and the conditions
he has to fulfil, are largely derived from the spell.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Closely connected with the questions discussed in the
preceding division, is the subject of the <i>systems of magic</i> and
the distinction between &lsquo;systematic&rsquo; and
&lsquo;independent&rsquo; magical rites and formul&aelig;. As we saw in
the beginning of this chapter, the whole body of magic naturally falls
into several big divisions, each of them corresponding to a department
of nature, such as wind or weather; to some activity of man, such as
gardening, fishing, hunting or warfare; or to some real or imaginary
force, such as artistic inspiration, witchcraft, personal charm or
prowess.</p>
<p>There is, however, an important distinction to be made within each
such division of magic; some of the rites and spells are isolated and
independent, they can be used by themselves, whenever the need arises.
Such are almost all the incantations of wind magic; some spells of
individual garden magic; formul&aelig; against toothache, and minor
ailments; some spells of hunting and food collecting; a few rites of
love magic and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413" name=
"pb413">413</a>]</span>of the magic of carving. When a man, for
instance, paddles along the Lagoon in his canoe and an unfavourable
wind sets in, he will utter a spell to make it abate and change. The
same spell would be recited in the village, when there arises a wind so
strong as to be dangerous. The incantation is a free, individual act,
which may be performed and is performed in any of the circumstances
which require it.</p>
<p>It is quite another matter with the spells belonging to what I have
called here <i>systematic magic</i>. Such magic consists of a connected
and consecutive body of incantations and concomitant rites, no one of
which can be torn out of its sequence and performed by itself. They
have to be carried out one after the other in a determined order, and
the more important of them, at least, can never be omitted, once the
series has been started. Such a series is always closely connected with
some activity, such as the building of a canoe or an overseas Kula
voyage, a fishing expedition or the making and harvesting of a garden.
It will not be difficult for us to realise the nature of systematic
magic, for in this book almost all the rites and spells described
belong to this class. In general, in the Trobriands, the independent
<span class="corr" id="xd26e13968" title=
"Source: uncorollated">uncorrelated</span> rites and formul&aelig; are
quite an insignificant minority, both in number and in importance.</p>
<p>Let us consider one of the forms of systematic magic previously
described, whether canoe magic or that of the Kula, whether the
<i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> formul&aelig;, or the magical ritual of
<i lang="kij">kaloma</i> fishing. The first general fact to be noted
here is, that we are in the presence of a type of enterprise or
activity, which is never embarked upon without magic. No canoe will be
built, no <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> started, no <i lang=
"kij">kaloma</i> fished, without its magic ceremonial. This ceremonial
will be scrupulously observed in its main features, that is, some of
the most important formul&aelig; will never be omitted, as some minor
ones might be, a fact which has been previously noted. The association
between the practical activity and its magical concomitant is very
intimate. The stages and acts of the first, and the rites and spells of
the latter, correspond to each other one by one. Certain rites have to
be done in order to inaugurate certain activities; others have to be
performed at the end of the practical work; others again are part and
parcel of the activity. But each of the rites and spells is to the
native mind, quite as indispensable for <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb414" href="#pb414" name="pb414">414</a>]</span>the success of the
enterprise, as is the practical activity. Thus, the <i lang=
"kij">tokway</i> has to be expelled, or the tree would be entirely
unsuitable for a canoe; the adze, the lashing creeper, the caulking and
the paint have to be charmed, or else the canoe would be heavy and
unwieldy, and such an omission might even prove dangerous to life.
Going mentally over the various cases quoted in the previous chapters,
it can be easily seen, how this intimate association between enterprise
and magic imparts to systematic magic its specific character. The
consecutive progress of work and of magic are inseparable, just
because, according to native ideas, work needs magic, and magic has
only meaning as an indispensable ingredient of work.</p>
<p>Both work and magic are directed towards the same aim; to construct
a swift and a stable canoe; to obtain a good Kula yield; to insure
safety from drowning and so on. Thus we see that systematic magic
consists in a body of rites and spells associated with one enterprise,
directed towards one aim, and progressing in a consecutive series of
performances which have to be carried out in their proper place. The
point&mdash;the proper understanding of what is meant by systematic
magic&mdash;is of the greatest theoretical importance because it
reveals the nature of the relation between magical and practical
activities, and shows how deeply the two are connected with one
another. It is one of these points, also, which cannot be properly
explained and grasped without the help of a Chart. In the appended
&ldquo;<a href="#table3">Table of Kula Magic and of the Corresponding
Activities</a>,&rdquo; I have prepared such a Chart, in which has been
summarised the substance of several of the foregoing Chapters. The
Table allows of a rapid survey of the consecutive activities of the
Kula in their relation to magic, beginning with the first act of
canoe-building and finishing with the return home. It shows the salient
features of systematic magic in general, and of the <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i> and canoe magic in particular. It shows the relation
between magical, ritual and practical activities, the correlated
sequence of the two, their rolling off, stage after stage, and side by
side, towards one central aim&mdash;a successful Kula. The Table thus
serves to illustrate the meaning of the expression &lsquo;systematic
magic,&rsquo; and it provides a firm outline of the essentials,
magical, ceremonial and practical, of the Kula. <span class=

<p>All the magic of this stage is canoe magic. It is performed only
when a new canoe is built and not when an old one is renovated. The
spells are uttered by the builder and not by the owner, except the
first one. Work at this stage is done by one man mainly, the builder
and carver, with the help of a few men; except for the pulling of the
log, in which many men assist.</p>

<p>Within each department of systematic magic, there are again various
<i>systems of magic</i>. Thus we saw that, although the type of rite
and formula is the same in all villages, the actual details, let us
say, of the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> magic, are not identical, but vary
according to the system with which a given reciter is acquainted. The
differences are, as a rule, less pronounced in the rites, which are
generally very simple in the Trobriand magic, and are identical in all
the systems, but the formul&aelig; differ completely in their wording.
Thus, in the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> magic (<a href="#div5.3">Chapter
V, Division III</a>) we found only a slight difference in the rite, but
one or two <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> spells, which I have also recorded,
differ essentially from the one given in the text.</p>
<p>Each system of magic has a more or less developed mythological
pedigree, and in connection with it a local character, a point which
has been elaborated in the previous Division. The <i lang=
"kij">wayugo</i> spell given in <a href="#ch5">Chapter V</a>, and all
the spells of canoe-building quoted in this book belong to the
Kaykudayuri system of canoe magic. This system is believed to have been
known and recited by the mythical builder of the flying canoe, and to
have been handed down to his descendants, that is, as we know, in an
incomplete form. As has been said in the <a href="#div17.6">previous
Division</a>, the knowledge and the use of this magic and of other
systems does not abide strictly within the original clan, but it
spreads outside of it, and it becomes known to many people who are
connected with the original owner by a sort of magical filiation.</p>
<p>According to native belief, all these people know identical
formul&aelig;. In fact, in the course of years and of repeated
transmission, considerable differences have been introduced, and
nowadays many of the &lsquo;real Kudayuri&rsquo; spells differ from one
another completely.</p>
<p>A system of magic is therefore a number of magical formul&aelig;,
forming one consecutive series. The main system of canoe magic is that
of the Kaykudayuri, which is associated with the place of the same name
in Kitava. This system comprises the whole series of canoe-building
spells, from the expelling of the <i lang="kij">tokway</i> to the final
exorcisms. Another comprehensive system is called Kaykapayouko, and is
localised in the island of Kayleula. An important system called
Ilumte&rsquo;ulo is nowadays claimed by Sinaketa, but probably hails
from Dobu. The mythological data of some of these systems are not
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb420" href="#pb420" name=
"pb420">420</a>]</span>known to me, and some of them seem to be
exceedingly rudimentary, not going beyond the assertion that such and
such a system originated at such and such a place, and was originally
the property of such and such a clan. Of the systems of <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i>, the best known in South Boyowa is that called
Monikiniki, to which belong the majority of the formul&aelig; here
quoted. This system is sometimes loosely associated with the myth of
Tokosikuna, who is sometimes said to have been the original owner of
the system. According to another version, Monikiniki is the name of the
original owner. The Dobuan <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> is called
Kasabwaybwayreta, and is ascribed to that hero. From Muyuwa, hails the
Momroveta system of Kula magic, while in Kiriwina the system of
Monikiniki is usually recited, and only a few formul&aelig; are
inserted into it, belonging to a local magic, called Kwoygapani (a name
not to be confused with the name in a formula quoted in <a href=
"#ch14">Chapter XIV</a>). In the light of these remarks, the many
references to &lsquo;magical systems&rsquo; given in the text, will
become clear, so there is no need to add more here.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We saw before in the chapter on mythology that magic
bridges over the cleavage between the super-normal world of myth and
the normal, ordinary happenings of to-day. But then, this bridge itself
must necessarily touch the super-normal, it must lead into that domain.
Magic surely, therefore, must partake of the supernatural character?
There is no doubt that it is so. The effects of magic, although
constantly witnessed, and although considered as a fundamental fact,
are regarded as something distinctly different from the effects of
other human activities. The natives realise quite well that the speed
and buoyancy of a canoe are due to the knowledge and work of the
constructor; they are well acquainted with the properties of good
material and of good craftsmanship. Yet the magic of swiftness adds
something more to even the best constructed canoe. This superadded
quality is regarded very much like the properties of the mythical canoe
which made it fly through the air, though in the present day canoes
these properties have dwindled down to mere surpassing speed.</p>
<p>The language of spells expresses this belief through the constant
allusions to myth, similes in which the present canoe is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb421" href="#pb421" name=
"pb421">421</a>]</span>invited to imitate the mythical one. In the
explicit comments on the Kudayuri myth, the natives also state
definitely that the prodigious speed which well-charmed canoes develop
is the legacy and counterpart of the old flying speed. Thus the effects
of magic are something superadded to all the other effects produced by
human effort and by natural qualities. The same is to be found in love
magic. The importance of a fine face and figure, of ornaments,
decorations and nice scents, is well recognised as being of attractive
value, yet almost every man ascribes his success to the perfection of
his love magic. The force of magic is considered as something
independent of, and surpassing even, the power of all other personal
charms. A statement very often met with expresses this quite well:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Look, I am not good looking, yet so many girls
want me. The reason of that is that I have good magic.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In garden magic, soil, rain, proper work, are given their full due.
None the less, no one would dream of making a garden without the full
magical performance being done over it. Garden magic is thought to make
just this difference, which a man hopes for from &lsquo;chance,&rsquo;
or &lsquo;good luck,&rsquo; when he sees everybody round him working as
hard as he can, and in all other respects under similar conditions to
himself. So we see that, in all these cases, magical influence runs
parallel to and independently of the effects of human work and natural
conditions. It produces these differences and those unexpected results,
which cannot be explained by any of the other factors.</p>
<p>So far, we see that magic represents, so to speak, a different sort
of reality. When I call this different sort &lsquo;super-natural&rsquo;
or &lsquo;super-normal,&rsquo; one of the criteria which I use here
lies in the emotional reaction of the natives. This, of course, is most
pronounced in the case of evil magic. The sorcerer is not only feared
because of his bad intentions. He is also feared as ghosts are feared
by us, as an uncanny manifestation. One is afraid of meeting him in the
dark, not so much because he might do any harm, but because his
appearance is dreadful and because he has at his bidding all sorts of
powers and faculties which are denied to those not versed in black
magic. His sweat glows, night birds run with him to give him warning;
he can become invisible at will and produce paralysing fear in those he
meets. In short, the same hysterical dread, associated <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb422" href="#pb422" name=
"pb422">422</a>]</span>amongst ourselves with the idea of haunted
places, is produced by the sorcerers in the minds of the natives. And
it must be added that the natives have no such emotion of dread at all
with regard to the spirits of the departed. The horror which they have
of the <i lang="kij">bwaga&rsquo;u</i> is even stronger in the case of
the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>, to whom all sorts of most uncanny
properties are attributed. Their ghoulish feasting on corpses, their
capacity of flying, of making themselves invisible, of changing into
night birds, all this inspires the natives with extreme terror.</p>
<p>The other magicians and their art do not inspire such strong
emotions in the natives, and of course in any case the emotion would
not be that of dread. There is a very great value and attachment to
systems of local magic, and their effects are distinctly considered as
an asset for a community.</p>
<p>Each form of magic also has its associated magical portent, <i lang=
"kij">kariyala</i>. When a magic formula is spoken, a violent natural
upheaval will take place. For example, when garden magic is performed,
there will be thunder and lightning; with certain forms of Kula magic,
a rainbow will appear in the skies. Others will produce shower clouds.
The portent of a mild storm, accompanying the opening of the magical
bundle (<i lang="kij">lilava</i>) has already been quoted. The <i lang=
"kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> may produce a tidal wave, whereas an earthquake
will be the result of other forms of magic. War magic, in an
unexpectedly bucolic way, affects only some plants and birds. In
certain forms of magic, a portent would take place whenever the formula
is uttered, in others, this will not be so regular, but a <i lang=
"kij">kariyala</i> will invariably occur when a magician dies. When
asked, what is the real cause of any of these natural phenomena
enumerated, they will say:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Magic is the real cause (<i lang=
"kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>); they are a <i lang="kij">kariyala</i> of
magic.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Another point, where magic touches the super-normal or supernatural,
is in the association of spirits with certain magical performances. A
special type of magical payment, the <i lang="kij">ula&rsquo;ula</i>,
is at the same time an offering to the <i lang="kij">baloma</i>
(spirits). The magician will detach a small bit of the large quantity
of food brought to him, and put it down on some special place, with the
words:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;Partake, O spirits, of your <i lang=
"kij">ula&rsquo;ula</i>, and make my magic thrive.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb423" href="#pb423" name=
"pb423">423</a>]</span></p>
<p>At certain ceremonies, the spirits are supposed to be present (see
<a href="#pl59">Plate LIX</a>). When something goes wrong with magic,
or it is badly performed, &lsquo;the spirits will become angry,&rsquo;
as it is often expressed by the natives. In some cases the <i lang=
"kij">baloma</i> will appear in dreams and advise the magician what to
do. As this is the most active interference of the spirits in human
affairs, as far as magic is concerned, I shall quote in free
translation some statements obtained on the matter.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The owners of fish magic will often dream that
there is plentiful fish. The cause of it is the magician&rsquo;s
ancestor spirit. Such a magician would then say: &lsquo;The ancestral
spirit has instructed me in the night, that we should go to catch fish!
And indeed, when we get there, we find plenty of fish, and we cast the
nets.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mokudeya, the maternal uncle of Narugo,&rdquo; who is, the
main fishing magician of Oburaku &ldquo;comes to his nephew in a dream
and instructs him: &lsquo;Tomorrow, cast the nets for fish in
Kwabwawa!&rsquo; Narugo then says: &lsquo;Let us come, the old man
instructed me last night.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i lang="kij">kaloma</i> (spondylus shell) magician of
Sinaketa dreams about a plentiful patch of <i lang="kij">kaloma</i>
shell. Next morning, he would dive and knock it off on the reef. Or he
dreams of a canoe, and he then paddles and casts the anchor at that
place. To&rsquo;udawada, Luvayam, Sinakadi dream that they knock it off
in plenty. When next morning we go there, it is plentiful.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In all these examples (except the last) we see that the spirits act
as advisors and helpers. They fill the r&ocirc;le of guardian of the
traditions when they get angry because of a bad <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e14742" title="Source: perforance">performance</span>, or as
associates and sympathisers when they share the magician&rsquo;s
<i lang="kij">ula&rsquo;ula</i>. But they are not agencies which get to
work directly. In the Trobriand demonology, the magician does not
command the spirits to go and set to work. The work is done by the
agency of the spell, assisted by the accompanying ritual, and performed
by the proper magician. The spirits stand in the same relation, as the
performer does, to the magical force, which alone is active. They can
help him to wield it properly, but they can never become his
instruments.</p>
<p>To summarise the results of what we have learned about the
super-normal nature of magic, it may be said that it has a definite
character of its own, which differentiates it from the non-magical
actions of man. The manner in which the magical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name=
"pb424">424</a>]</span>force is conceived to act, parallel to the
ordinary efforts but independent of them; the emotional reaction to
certain types of magic and magician; the <i lang="kij">kariyala</i>;
the intercourse with spirits during the performances, all these
properties differentiate magic from the ordinary activities of man.</p>
<p>In native terminology, the realm of the magical is called by the
word <i lang="kij">megwa</i>, which describes the &lsquo;magical
performance,&rsquo; the &lsquo;spell,&rsquo; the &lsquo;force&rsquo; or
&lsquo;virtue&rsquo; of magic, and can be used as adjective to describe
in general everything which presents a magical character. Used as a
verb, the words <i lang="kij">megwa, miga-megwa, miga</i>, all of which
are variations of the same root, mean: &lsquo;to perform magic,&rsquo;
&lsquo;to utter a spell,&rsquo; &lsquo;to carry out a rite.&rsquo; If
the natives want to express that certain actions are done in connection
with magic, and not with work, and that certain effects are due to
magical forces, and not to other efforts, they used the word <i lang=
"kij">megwa</i> as a substantive or adjective. It is never used to
describe any virtue residing in a man or a thing, nor for any action
which is independent of a spell.</p>
<p>The associated concept of taboo is covered by the Kiriwinian word
<i lang="kij">bomala</i> (with suffixed possessive pronouns). It means
a &lsquo;prohibition,&rsquo; something which a man is not allowed to do
under any circumstances. It is used for magical taboos, for
prohibitions associated with rank, for restrictions in regard to food
generally considered as unclean, as, for example, the flesh of lizards,
snakes, dogs and man. There is hardly any trace of the meaning of
&lsquo;sacred&rsquo; attached to the word <i lang="kij">bomala</i>. If
anywhere, it can be found in the use of the word <i lang=
"kij">boma</i>, for a tabooed grove where men usually are not allowed
to enter, and where traditional spots, often original holes where men
came out and whence magic issued, are to be found. The expression
<i lang="kij">toboma</i> (<i lang="kij">to-</i>, prefix denoting
personal noun) means a man of high rank, but hardly a sacred man.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Finally, a few words must be said about the
sociological or ceremonial setting of magic. Reference has often been
made to the simplicity of rites, and to their matter-of-fact character.
This has been mentioned with reference to canoe-building, and in garden
magic we would have found equally simple and purely businesslike
performances. In calling a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href=
"#pb425" name="pb425">425</a>]</span>magical action
&lsquo;ceremonial&rsquo; we imply that it was done with a big public
attendance; under the observance of definite rules of behaviour by the
spectators as well as by the performer, such as general silence,
reverent attention to what is being done, with at least a show of some
interest. Now if, in the middle of some work, a man quickly performs an
action whilst others talk and laugh and leave him entirely on one side,
this gives a definite sociological stamp to the magical actions, and
does not allow us to use the term &lsquo;ceremonial,&rsquo; as the
distinguishing mark of the magical acts. Some of them, it is true, do
have this character. For instance, the initial rite with which the
<i lang="kij">kaloma</i> fishing begins, requires the assistance of the
whole fleet, and a definite type of behaviour on the part of the crews,
while the magician officiates for all of them, but with their
assistance, in the complex evolutions of the fleet. Similar rites are
to be found in two or three systems of fishing magic, and in several
rites of the garden magic of certain villages. In fact, the initial
rite of garden magic is everywhere connected with a ceremonial
performance. The garden rite, associated with the ceremonial offering
of food to spirits, and attended by a body of villagers, a scene of
which is shown on <a href="#pl59">Plate LIX</a>, has been elsewhere
described.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e14797src" href="#xd26e14797"
name="xd26e14797src">3</a> One or two rites in war magic imply the
active assistance of large numbers of men, and take the form of big
ceremonies. Thus we see that magical rites may or may not be
ceremonial, but that the ceremonial is by no means an outstanding or
universal feature of Trobriand magic.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We found that taboos are associated with magic, in so
far as it is the magician who has to observe them. There are, however,
certain forms of restrictions or prohibitions, set up for special
purposes, and associated with magic in a somewhat different form. Thus,
in an institution called <i lang="kij">kaytubutabu</i> we find a ban
made on the consumption of coco-nuts and betel-nuts, associated with a
specific magic to make them grow. There is also a protective taboo,
used to prevent the theft of ripening fruits or nuts, too far away from
the village to be watched. In these cases a small parcel of medicated
substance is placed on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href=
"#pb426" name="pb426">426</a>]</span>the tree or near it, on a small
stick. The magic spoken over such a substance is a &lsquo;conditional
curse,&rsquo; to use the excellent term introduced by <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e14811" title="Source: Professsor">Professor</span>
Westermarck. The conditional curse would fall upon anyone who would
touch the fruits of that tree, and would bring upon him one form of
disease or another. This is the only form of magic, in which the
personal agency is invoked, for in some of these spells, the <i lang=
"kij">tokway</i> (<span class="corr" id="xd26e14817" title=
"Source: wood sprite">wood-sprite</span>) is invited to take up his
abode on the <i lang="kij">kaytapaku</i>, that is the stick, with the
substance on it, and to guard the fruit. Some such small divergencies
from the general trend of native belief are always to be found.
Sometimes they contain important clues, and a deeper insight into the
facts, sometimes they mean nothing, and only emphasise the fact, that
it is not possible to find absolute consistency in human belief. Only a
deeper analysis, and a comparative study of similar phenomena can
decide which is the case.</p>

<p class="first">In order to complete the survey of all the
characteristics of magic, I shall rapidly mention here the economic
aspect of the position of magician, although the data referring to it
have already been given, scattered through the previous chapters. I
have spoken of the matrilineal inheritance of magic, and of the
deviations from it which consist in inheritance from father to son, and
in the transmission of magic by purchase (<a href="#div2.6">Chapter II,
<span class="corr" id="xd26e14831" title=
"Source: Divison">Division</span> VI</a>, and <a href="#div6.6">Chapter
VI, Division VI</a> under (5)). This latter transaction may take place
under two names, which really cover two essentially different
operations; the <i lang="kij">pokala</i> or payment to a maternal
kinsman from whom one is going to obtain the magic, and the <i lang=
"kij">laga</i>, which is the purchase of magic from a stranger. Only
certain forms of magic can freely pass from one clan or sub-clan to
another, and are purchasable by the <i lang="kij">laga</i> system. The
majority of magical systems are local, and can descend only in the same
sub-clan with an occasional deviation to the son of a member, from
whom, however, the magic must return to the sub-clan again. A further
economic feature of magic is the payment, which the magician receives
for his services. There are many types of payment; some given
occasionally by an individual for a definite act of magic, as in the
case of sorcery or healing magic; others, paid at regular intervals by
the whole community, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb427" href=
"#pb427" name="pb427">427</a>]</span>in the case of garden and fishing
magic. In some cases the payments are considerable, as in sorcery, in
rain and fine weather magic, and in garden magic. In others, they
amount to little more than a mere formal offering.</p>

<p class="first">In all this, we have been dealing with general
characteristics of Boyowan (Trobriand) magic. This has been done mainly
on the basis of the material presented in this volume, with only a few
examples from other branches of magic. The result so far can be set
down thus: magic to the natives represents a special department; it is
a specific power, essentially human, autonomous and independent in its
action. This power is an inherent property of certain words, uttered
with the performance of certain actions by the man entitled to do it
through his social traditions and through certain observances which he
has to keep. The words and acts have this power in their own right, and
their action is direct and not mediated by any other agency. Their
power is not derived from the authority of spirits or demons or
supernatural beings. It is not conceived as having been wrested from
nature. The belief in the power of words and rites as a fundamental and
irreducible force is the ultimate, basic dogma of their magical creed.
Hence we find established the ideas that one never can tamper with,
change or improve spells; that tradition is the only source from which
they can be derived; that it has brought them down from times lying
beyond the speculation of man, that there can be no spontaneous
generation of magic.</p>
<p>We are naturally led now to inquire one stage further into the
manner in which the magical words and rites act. Obviously the only way
to obtain correct information on this point is to analyse and compare a
great number of well authenticated formul&aelig;, and minutely recorded
rites. Even the collection of Kula magic here partially given in free
translation, would allow us to arrive at certain interesting
conclusions. But we can go deeper still with the help of linguistic
analysis, and we shall proceed to this inquiry in the next chapter.

association of magic with any vital interest is demonstrated by the
case of pearling. Here, through the advent of white men, a new and very
lucrative and absorbing pursuit has opened up for the natives. A form
of magic is now in existence, associated with this fishing. This of
course apparently contradicts the native dogma that magic cannot be
invented. The natives, if faced with this contradiction, explain that
it is really an old magic of shell fishing which refers to all the
shells found at the bottom of the Lagoon, but which so far had only
been used with regard to fishing for the Conus. In fact, this magic is
nothing but the adaptation of the <i lang="kij">mwali</i> (armshell)
magic to the pearls. I doubt, none the less, whether even such a
transference or adaptation would have taken place before the

number, what sort of words are believed to exercise magical power.
This, of course, does not mean that we are under the delusion that the
composers or <span class="corr" id="xd26e14868" title=
"Source: inventers">inventors</span> of magic had a theory about the
efficiency of words, and carried this theory into practice by inventing
the formula. But, as the moral ideas and rules prevalent in society,
though not codified, can be found out by analysing human behaviour; as
we reach the underlying principles of law and social propriety by
examining customs and manners; as in the study of rites, we see some
definite tenets of belief and dogmas&mdash;so, in analysing the direct
verbal expressions of certain modes of thinking in the magical
formul&aelig;, we are justified in assuming that these modes of
thinking must have somehow guided those who shaped them. The exact
manner in which we must imagine the relation between a typical way of
thinking in a society on the one hand, and the fixed, crystallised
results of this thinking on the other, is a problem of Social
Psychology. For this branch of science we are, in ethnography, under
the obligation of gathering material, but we need not encroach upon its
field of study.</p>
<p>Thus much may, however, be put down, that, in whatever manner we
might imagine a spell to have come into existence, it cannot be
considered as the creation of one man; for as has been said before, if
we examine any one of them, not with the eyes of the natives, but as
outside critics, each spell shows unmistakable signs of being a
collection of linguistic additions from different epochs. There is in
practically every one of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href=
"#pb429" name="pb429">429</a>]</span>them a good deal of archaic
material, but not a single one bears the stamp of having come down to
us in the same form in which it must have presented itself a few
generations ago. So that it may be said that a spell is constantly
being remoulded as it passes through the chain of magicians, each
probably leaving his mark, however small, upon it. It is the general
attitude in matters of magical belief common to all of the successive
holders which will be at the bottom of all the regularities, all the
typical features found in the spells.</p>
<p>I shall adduce a formula of canoe magic and one of the spells
belonging to the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i>, choosing two texts of which
a translation and a commentary of average quality have been obtained,
and which show clearly the several characteristic features of verbal
magic. Those who are not interested in linguistic technicalities and
details of method, may omit the following division, and take up the
trend of our argument at <a href="#div18.12">division XII</a>.</p>

<p class="first">The following text is the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i>
spell, obtained from Layseta, the headman of Kopila, one of the
sub-villages of Sinaketa. The commentary was obtained from himself, and
from another informant, Motago&rsquo;i, a man of exceptional
intelligence, and a very straightforward and a reliable informant. This
spell has been given in free translation before in Chapter <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e14891" title="Source: VI">V</span>, and, as has been
said there, the rite consists simply in chanting the words over five

<p>We have here the native text, translated word for word, each
expression and formative affix being rendered by its English
equivalent. In obtaining such a verbatim translation and subsequently
putting it into a free, intelligible English rendering, there are two
main difficulties to be overcome. A considerable proportion of the
words found in magic do not belong to ordinary speech, but are
archaisms, mythical names and strange compounds, formed according to
unusual linguistic rules. Thus the first task is to elucidate the
obsolete expressions, the mythical references, and to find the present
day equivalents of any archaic words. Even if we obtain a series of
meanings corresponding to each term of the original text, there is
often considerable difficulty in linking these meanings together. Magic
is not built up in the narrative style; it does not serve to
communicate ideas from one person to another; it does not purport to
contain a consecutive, consistent meaning. It is an instrument serving
special purposes, intended for the exercise of man&rsquo;s specific
power over things, and <i>its meaning</i>, giving this word a wider
sense, can be understood only in correlation to this aim. It will not
be therefore a meaning of logically or topically concatenated ideas,
but of expressions fitting into one another and into the whole,
according to what could be called a magical order of thinking, or
perhaps more correctly, a magical order of expressing, of launching
words towards their aim. It is clear that this magical order of verbal
concatenations&mdash;I am purposely avoiding the expression
&lsquo;magical logic&rsquo; for there is no logic in the
case&mdash;must be known and familiar to anyone who wishes really to
understand the spells. There is therefore a great initial difficulty in
&lsquo;reading&rsquo; such documents, and only an acquaintance with a
great number makes one more confident and more competent. <span class=

<p class="first">In the ordinary routine of working out such texts, I
tried to obtain from the magician the equivalents, word for word, of
the more cryptic expressions. As a rule the magician himself knows a
good deal more than anyone else about the mythical references, and
about certain esoteric expressions contained in the spell. There are
some unintelligent old men, unfortunately, who rattle off a formula,
and who evidently never were interested about its significance or else
forgot all about it, and are no good as commentators. Often a fairly
good informant, quite capable of reciting a spell slowly and
intelligibly, without losing his thread, will be of no use as
linguistic informant, that is in helping to obtain a definition of a
word, in assisting to break it up into its formative parts; in
explaining which words belong to ordinary speech, which are dialectic,
which are archaic, and which are purely magical compounds. I had only a
few informants who could help me in this way, and among them the
previously mentioned Motago&rsquo;i was one of the best.</p>
<p>The analysis to which I now proceed can be given only in an
approximate manner, for in a full one, a long disquisition on grammar
would have to be given first. It will be enough, however, to show in
broad outline the main linguistic features of a spell, as well as the
methods which have been used in constructing the free translation given
in the previous chapters.</p>
<p>The formula here quoted, shows the typical tripartition of the
longer spells. The first part is called <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>.
This word means the &lsquo;bottom part&rsquo; of a tree or post, the
&lsquo;foundation&rsquo; of any structure, and in more figurative uses,
it means &lsquo;reason<span class="corr" id="xd26e15859" title=
"Not in source">,</span>&rsquo; &lsquo;cause,&rsquo; or, again,
&lsquo;beginning.&rsquo; It is in this last sense that the natives
apply it to the first strophe of a song, and to the exordium of a
magical formula. The second part of the spell is called <i lang=
"kij">tapwana</i>, literally: &lsquo;surface,&rsquo;
&lsquo;skin,&rsquo; &lsquo;body,&rsquo; &lsquo;trunk,&rsquo;
&lsquo;middle part&rsquo; of a tree, &lsquo;main part&rsquo; of a road,
and thus &lsquo;main part&rsquo; of a spell or song. The word <i lang=
"kij">dogina</i>, literally the &lsquo;tip&rsquo; or &lsquo;end,&rsquo;
used for the &lsquo;tip&rsquo; of a tree or the &lsquo;end&rsquo; of a
tail, is used to designate the &lsquo;final part&rsquo; or the
&lsquo;conclusion&rsquo; of a spell. Sometimes the word <i lang=
"kij">dabwana</i>, &lsquo;top,&rsquo; or &lsquo;head,&rsquo; (not human
head) is substituted for <i lang="kij">dogina</i>. Thus the spell must
be imagined turned upside down, its beginning put at the basis,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434</a>]</span>the <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>, its main part
where the middle trunk would be, and its end at the tip, the <i lang=
"kij">dogina</i>.</p>
<p>The opening words of the <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i> in this spell
are short, cutting, pithy expressions, each standing for its own cycle
of ideas, for a sentence or even a whole story. In this they are
typical of the beginnings of Kiriwinian spells. They are also typical,
in the great difficulty which they present to the interpreter. Out of
the seven words contained in phrases 1 and 2, four do not belong to
ordinary speech, and are obscure compounds. Thus the words <i lang=
"kij">bosisi&rsquo;ula</i> and <i lang="kij">bomwalela</i> are made up
first of the prefix <i lang="kij">bo-</i>, which carries with it the
meaning of &lsquo;tabooed,&rsquo; &lsquo;belonging to magic,&rsquo; and
of the two roots <i lang="kij">sisiula</i> and <i lang=
"kij">mwalela</i>, neither of which is a complete word. The first is
the root part of the word <i lang="kij">visisi&rsquo;ula</i>, which
designates a custom associated with this magic. At certain times, in
connection with the performance of the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> rite,
the magician has fits of trembling and then he has to be given some
baked fish, and after partaking of it his trembling fit passes. The
natives say that he trembles like a <i lang="kij">bisila</i> (pandanus
streamer) and that this shows that his magic is good, since the
trembling of the pandanus is a symbol of speed. <i lang=
"kij">Mwalela</i> is derived from <i lang="kij">olumwalela</i> which
means &lsquo;inside.&rsquo; With the prefix <i lang="kij">bo-</i> the
word can be translated &lsquo;the tabooed inside.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is even more difficult to interpret the general meaning of these
two expressions, than to find out their literal equivalents. We have an
allusion to a ritual eating of fish, associated with a trembling which
symbolises speed, and we have an expression &lsquo;tabooed
inside.&rsquo; The custom of eating fish after trembling has a magical
importance. It adds to the efficiency of magic, as all such observances
do. The force or merit of this observance, which, dissociated from the
spell and the rite can have no direct effect, is made available by
being mentioned in the formula; it is so to speak, magically
discounted. This is the best way in which I can interpret the two words
of ritual eating and of tabooed interior of the magician.</p>
<p>The three words of sentence 2 have each to tell its own story. The
word <i lang="kij">papapa</i>, &lsquo;flutter,&rsquo; stands for a
phrase: &ldquo;let the canoe speed so that the pandanus leaves
flutter.&rdquo; Of course the word expresses much more than this
sentence, because it is intelligible only to those who are acquainted
with the part played by the pandanus leaves in the decoration of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=
"pb435">435</a>]</span>canoes, with the native ideas about magical
association between flutter and speed, and with the ritual use of
pandanus streamers. Therefore the word has a meaning only if taken with
the context of this formula, in connection with its aim, with the
various associated ideas and customs. To the native, who knows all this
and in whose mind the whole context rises, when he hears or repeats
&lsquo;<i lang="kij">papapa</i>&rsquo; the word quivers with magical
force. The word <i lang="kij">silubida</i>, an especial magical
transformation of <i lang="kij">lilobida</i>, stands for a certain
variety of the betel pepper plant. The word <i lang=
"kij">monagakalava</i> is again an elaborate compound carrying the
meaning &lsquo;to leave behind.&rsquo; The betel plant is a common
magical ingredient, and in this spell, the ancestral spirits will
presently be invited to chew betel-nut. &lsquo;Leaving behind&rsquo;
undoubtedly refers to the other canoes which will be outrun by that of
the reciter. Both these words, therefore, can be placed without much
difficulty into the context of this spell. It is quite clear, as has
been said, that each of these expressions stands alone and represents a
self-contained cycle of ideas. The two expressions of sentence 1
probably do belong to one another, but even they represent each
one-half of a complex story.</p>
<p>Then, in 3, there comes a long list of names of ancestors, all of
whom are said to be real men who had lived in Kitava, the home of this
magic. The words <i lang="kij">kwaysa&rsquo;i</i>, &lsquo;stormy
sea,&rsquo; and <i lang="kij">pulupolu</i>, &lsquo;boiling up,&rsquo;
&lsquo;foaming up,&rsquo; suggest that the names are significant and
therefore mythical. Nawabudoga, a Kitavan man, was father of the
last-mentioned one, Mogilawota, a maternal relative of the present
owner. We see here, therefore, a good case of &lsquo;magical
filiation,&rsquo; by which the present owner, a man of Sinaketa, is
connected with the mythical district of Kitava.</p>
<p>The following two sentences, 4 and 5, are linguistically much
clearer and simpler, and they present connected sequences of words.
They are an invocation to ancestral spirits, asking them to join the
magician at the canoe, which is called here Kaykudayuri, &lsquo;the
craft of the Kudayuri,<span class="corr" id="xd26e15955" title=
"Source: &ldquo;">&rsquo;</span> and to place the pandanus streamers on
the top of Teulo. This, in an exaggerated and figurative speech,
expresses an invitation to the spirits to follow the man on his trip.
It must be noted that, according to the present belief at least, the
spirits are not conceived as agents or forces which carry the canoe at
the behest of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436"
name="pb436">436</a>]</span>magician, but as passive companions only.
Sentence 6 contains a scornful address to his companions; the magician
in prospect sees himself sailing ahead towards the mountains; as he
turns round, the Kitava men, that is his companions, are far behind on
the beach of To&rsquo;uru, and the whole sea-arm of Pilolu still lies
before them.</p>
<p>In 7, the same trend of ideas is followed; the custom of kindling
the fire by the first canoe is alluded to, and the magician sees
himself carrying out this privilege. It is to be noted that he speaks
always of his canoe under the name of Kudayuri, that is of the mythical
flying canoe of ancient times. In 8, the canoe is addressed as a flying
witch, who is asked to bind her skirt together and to fly. In 9, the
magician verbally retraces an incident from the original myth of
Kudayuri. He takes the adze handle, gets hold of the canoe, and strikes
it, whereupon the canoe flies.</p>
<p>Thus the <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i> begins with archaic,
condensed compounds each carrying a self-contained cycle of magical
meaning. Then follows a list of forbears; then more explicit and, at
the same time more dramatic sentences; an invocation to ancestral
spirits, the anticipated victory in speed, the reconstructed mythical
incident.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">IV</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us pass now to the <i lang="kij">tapwana</i>. This
is always the longest part of a spell, since we have a whole list of
words which have to be repeated with several key expressions, of which
in the present case there are three. Moreover, the magician can
<i lang="la">ad libitum</i> repeat the same words over and over again
with a key word. He will not go in any fixed order over all the words
of the list, but is allowed, in this part of the formula, to return and
repeat with one key-word the various items of the list.</p>
<p>It will be best to say here a few words about the manner in which
the magical formul&aelig; are actually recited. The opening words are
always intoned with a strong, melodious cadence which is not
permanently fixed, but varies with the magician. The first words are
repeated some several times. Thus here, <i lang="kij">kala
bosisi&rsquo;ula</i> would be reiterated three or four times, and so
would be the following two words (<i lang="kij">kala bomwalela</i>).
The words of No. 2 are recited slowly and ponderously but not repeated.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=
"pb437">437</a>]</span>The list of ancestors is run over quickly and
perfunctorily. The rest of the <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>, its
dramatic part so to speak, is spoken with less melody, more with the
ordinary speaking voice and more rapidly.</p>
<p>Then comes the last sentence of the <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>,
which in almost all spells links it up with the main part. This is
always intoned slowly, solemnly and distinctly; the voice drops at the
end by the interval of a tone. In the <i lang="kij">tapwana</i>, the
key word, or key expression, which forms always the concluding part of
the <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>, is taken up again. It is repeated
several times, as if to fix or rub it well in. Then, dropping into a
quick, continuous stream of utterance, the magician runs over one word
of the list after the other. The key-word is inserted between each of
them, said sometimes once, sometimes two or three times. It gives an
effect as if the key-word were being rubbed in into every one of the
other expressions. They as a rule spoken more slowly, mark the rhythm
of this part. The reciting of the last part of a spell, the <i lang=
"kij">dogina</i> or <i lang="kij">dabwana</i>, is more perfunctory,
usually it is rather spoken than chanted.</p>
<p>After this digression, let us return to the analysis of our spell.
It is a rule that the <i lang="kij">tapwana</i>, the main part of a
formula, is easier to translate, expressed in less archaic and less
condensed terms, than the <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>. The <i lang=
"kij">tapwana</i> of this spell has quite easy key-words, both in its
first and in its second part. In the first one (phrase 11) the
key-words are of mythical nature, referring to localities associated
with the flying of one of the Kudayuri sisters. In the second <i lang=
"kij">tapwana</i>, the key-word means: &lsquo;I might heel over&rsquo;
or &lsquo;I shall heel over,&rsquo; that is with speed. And this
expression stands here for: &lsquo;I shall overtake,&rsquo; and the
list of words pronounced with this verb denotes the various parts of a
canoe. The second part of the <i lang="kij">tapwana</i> (phrase 14) is
much more typical than the first, because the key word is a verb,
whilst the list words are nouns. It is typical also, in that the verb
expresses, in a simple and direct manner, the magical effect of the
spell (the overtaking of the other canoes) whereas the sum of the words
of the list gives the object of the spell, that is, the canoe. Such
<i lang="kij">tapwana</i>, in which the magical action is expressed as
a verb, while in the list of words we have mentioned the various parts
of a garden or of fishing nets, or weapons or parts of the human body,
are to be found in all classes of magic. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb438" href="#pb438" name="pb438">438</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first part of the <i lang="kij">tapwana</i> (phrases 11, 12, and
13) is less typical, in so far that the verbs depicting various magical
actions are relegated into the list, while the key-words are adverbial
expressions of locality. The verbal links of the long chain express all
and one in a metaphoric manner the speed of the canoe. &lsquo;I shall
fly, I shall become like smoke, I shall become invisible, I shall
become as a wind eddy, etc,<span class="corr" id="xd26e16035" title=
"Source: &ldquo;">&rsquo;</span> are all rather picturesque, concrete
descriptions of surpassing speed. They present also a linguistic
symmetry and singularity. The prefix <i lang="kij">ba-</i> is the form
of the future or potential tense, which I have literally translated
&lsquo;might,&rsquo; but which stands here for &lsquo;shall<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e16041" title="Not in source">.</span>&rsquo; The
formative prefix <i lang="kij">yo-</i> is a causative, and stands for
&lsquo;become as&rsquo; or &lsquo;become like.&rsquo; Then follows the
root: <i lang="kij">kokoba-</i> &lsquo;smoke which trails in clouds
above a burning garden.&rsquo; Hence the expression <i lang=
"kij">bayokokoba</i>, in its full concrete meaning, could be
translated: &lsquo;I shall become like clouds of trailing smoke.&rsquo;
Again, <i lang="kij">boyowaysula</i> in its full meaning could be
translated: &lsquo;I shall become invisible as distant spray.&rsquo;
The only abstract word in this list is <i lang="kij">tamwa&rsquo;u</i>,
which literally means, &lsquo;to disappear.&rsquo; So, in this <i lang=
"kij">tapwana</i>, the list consists of a number of formally similar
words, each expressing the same general meaning in a concrete
metaphorical manner. The length of the whole <i lang="kij">tapwana</i>
(main body) of the spell can be imagined, since in the middle between
its two sections the <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i> is recited once
more.</p>
<p>The last part of this spell, the <i lang="kij">dogina</i>, contains
an explicit allusion to the Kudayuri myth and to several geographic
localities, which are mentioned in that myth. It also shows the usual
<i>crescendo</i>, characteristic of the conclusions of a spell. The
final results are anticipated in exaggerated, forceful language.</p>

<p class="first">So much about the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> spell. I
shall adduce now another spell of a somewhat different type, belonging
to the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> (Kula magic). It is distinctly a more
modern formula; there are hardly any archaic expressions; words are not
used, as independent sentences each; on the whole it is easily
understandable and has a consecutive meaning.</p>

<p>The opening sentences of the formula are so clear that the
translation word for word explains itself without any closer
commentary, except of course as far as the names are concerned.
Laba&rsquo;i is a village in the North of Kiriwina, and it plays a
considerable part in the mythology of the origin of man, since several
of the principal sub-clans emerged there from underground. Laba&rsquo;i
is also the home of the mythical culture-hero Tudava. The mythology of
the Kula, however, does not include Laba&rsquo;i amongst the places, on
which it touches. Perhaps this somewhat anomalous features of the
formula may <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href="#pb441" name=
"pb441">441</a>]</span>be connected with its obvious linguistic
modernity? The other personal name mentioned in this spell is Kwoyregu,
on which Layseta, who gave me this magic, commented in the following
manner:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;A man, he lived in Laba&rsquo;i, the master of
the magic. It was not this man who first knew the magic of Monikiniki.
That magic was partly found by Tokosikuna, partly in olden days in
Sinaketa.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In explaining this commentary it must be noted that the informant
was a Sinaketan man, hence his local patriotism, for there is no
definite, mythological version connecting the early practice of the
<i lang="kij">mwasila</i> with the village of Sinaketa. As we saw,
Tokosikuna is indeed one of the mythical heroes with whose story the
magic of <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> is associated. Monikiniki is the
name of one of the systems of the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> magic,
which usually is said to come from a man of that name.</p>
<p>Phrase 2 of this spell contains four couples, each consisting of a
compound and a verb. The substantival compounds have all, according to
the alliterative symmetry so dear to Kiriwinian magic, the prefix
<i lang="kij">silimway-</i>, derived from <i lang="kij">sulumwoya</i>,
the mint plant. Such play on words, especially on what is the leading
word in a spell, as <i lang="kij">sulumwoya</i> is here, shows that the
purely phonetic handling of words must be associated with the idea or
feeling of their inherent power. The keyword of the <i lang=
"kij">tapwana</i> (phrase 3), has been translated, literally &lsquo;it
boils.&rsquo; Perhaps it might have been translated in its other
slightly different meaning &lsquo;it foams.&rsquo; Probably it has both
meanings to the mind of the native reciter. I think that the use of a
word fraught with two meanings at the same time is one of the
characteristics of native language. In this spell, for instance, the
word <i lang="kij">polu</i> appears as one in a series of such verbs as
&lsquo;to roar,&rsquo; &lsquo;to quake,&rsquo; &lsquo;to sough,&rsquo;
all carrying the meaning of &lsquo;noise,&rsquo;
&lsquo;commotion,&rsquo; &lsquo;stir,&rsquo; a meaning which is in
harmony with the magical effects to be produced by the <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i> magic. In this context the obvious translation of the
word would be: &lsquo;to foam.&rsquo; On the other hand, this spell is
said over a piece of mint, which will be preserved in boiled coco-nut
oil, and the double meaning here contained might be paraphrased in this
manner: &ldquo;as the oil of the <i lang="kij">sulumwoya</i> boils, so
may my renown (or the eagerness of my partner?) foam up.&rdquo; Thus
the word <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442" name=
"pb442">442</a>]</span><i lang="kij">polu</i> would link up the meaning
of the rite of boiling with the context of this spell. This
explanation, however, has not been obtained from a native informant,
though it is undoubtedly in keeping with the general type of current
explanations. What I have called before the magical concatenation of
magical ideas consists in just such connections of words and their
meanings.</p>
<p>The <i lang="kij">dogina</i> (final part) contains one or two
typical features. For instance, in phrase 4, the maternal uncle of the
present reciter is asked to breathe the spell over the head of
Monikiniki. In this, the present owner of the spell identifies his
canoe with that of the mythical hero. In 5, 6 and 7, we have several
grandiloquent expressions such as that <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e17079" title="Source: refering">referring</span> to the commotion
on the mountain; that comparing his renown to thunder, and his treading
to the noise made by <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>; and that describing
how the <i lang="kij">waga</i> will sink, through being overfilled with
valuables. The last part would, as usual, be recited in a much more
perfunctory and quick manner, giving it the effect of piling up words,
one forceful phrase following another It ends with the onomatopoetic
sound <i lang="kij">tudududu</i> &hellip; which stands for the roll of
the thunder.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The two specimens of magic here given in the original
with a verbal translation, show how the linguistic analysis allows us a
much deeper insight into the magical value of words, as it is felt by
the natives. On the one hand, the various phonetic characteristics show
the handling of words when these have to convey magical force. On the
other hand, only an analysis word for word of the spells could give us
a good insight into the frequently mentioned magical concatenation of
ideas and verbal expressions. It is, however, impossible to adduce here
all the spells in their full original version with linguistic comments,
as this would lead us into a treatise on the language of magic. We may,
however, quickly pass over some of the other spells and point out in
them the salient features of magical expression, and thus amplify the
results so far obtained by the detailed analysis of these two
spells.</p>
<p>Of course these two examples belong to the longer type consisting of
three parts. Many of the spells previously quoted in free translation
contain no main part, though it is possible to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>distinguish their <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>
(exordium) from their <i lang="kij">dogina</i> (finale). The very first
spell quoted in <a href="#ch5">Chapter <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e17108" title="Source: VI">V</span></a>, the formula of the
<i lang="kij">Vabusi Tokway</i> (the expulsion of the <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e17115" title="Source: wood sprite">wood-sprite</span>)
is an anomalous one. It is an invocation, and it is not even chanted
but has to be spoken in a low persuasive voice. It consists of two
parts: in the first one the word <i lang="kij">kubusi</i> (&lsquo;thou
comest down&rsquo;) used as an imperative, &lsquo;come down!&rsquo; is
repeated with all sorts of descriptions and circumscriptions of the
woodsprites. In the second part, several sentences are repeated to make
the wood-sprite feel that he has been chased away. Both the keyword of
the first part, <i lang="kij">kubusi</i>, and the sentences of the
second part have a direct force of their own. It must be realised that,
for the natives, it is a great insult to be told to go away. <i lang=
"kij">Yoba</i>, the &lsquo;expulsion,&rsquo; the &lsquo;command to
go,&rsquo; stands in a category of its own. People are <i lang=
"kij">yoba&rsquo;d</i>, expelled from communities in certain
circumstances, and a man would never dream of remaining, when thus
treated. Therefore the words in this spell possess a force due to
social sanctions of native custom. The next spell, given in <a href=
"#ch6">Chapter VI</a>, the <i lang="kij">Kaymomwa&rsquo;u</i>, is also
anomalous for it consists of one part only. The word <i lang=
"kij">kubusi</i>, &lsquo;come down&rsquo; is also repeated here, with
various words designating defilements and broken taboos. These
qualities are, however, not thought of as personified beings. The force
of the word is probably also derived from the ideas about the <i lang=
"kij">yoba</i>.</p>
<p>The second spell, which is a pendant to the <i lang=
"kij">Kaymomwa&rsquo;u</i>, the <i lang="kij">Kaygagabile</i>, or spell
of lightness, begins with a typical <i lang=
"kij">u&rsquo;ula:</i>&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="intra"><span lang="kij" class="top">Susuwayliguwa
(repeated);</span> <span lang="en-uk" class="bottom">He fails to outrun
me;</span></span> <span class="intra"><span lang="kij" class=
"top">Titavaguwa (repeated);</span> <span lang="en-uk" class=
"bottom">the canoe trembles with speed;</span></span> <span class=
"intra"><span lang="kij" class="top">mabuguwa (repeated)</span>
<span lang="en-uk" class="bottom">magical word;</span></span>
<span class="intra"><span lang="kij" class="top">mabugu,</span>
<span lang="en-uk" class="bottom">mabugu,</span></span> <span class=
"intra"><span lang="kij" class="top">mabugamugwa;</span> <span lang=
"en-uk" class="bottom">mabugu-ancient;</span></span> <span class=

class="bottom">mabugu,</span></span> <span class="intra"><span lang=
"kij" class="top">mabuguva&rsquo;u.</span> <span lang="en-uk" class=
"bottom">mabugu-new.</span></span></p>
<p>The first two words are compounds with prefixes and suffixes added
for magical purposes, as a sort of magical trimming. The untranslatable
word, said by the natives to be <i lang="kij">megwa wala</i>
(&lsquo;just magic&rsquo;) is repeated several times in symmetry with
the previous two words and then with the two suffixes; ancient and new.
Such repetitions with prefixes or suffixes of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444</a>]</span>antithetic meaning are a frequent feature of
magical trimming of words. This exordium affords a clear example of the
magical play on words, of transformations for the sake of rhythm and
symmetry; of repetitions of the same words with antithetic affixes. In
the following part of the spell, the word <i lang="kij">ka&rsquo;i</i>
(tree) is repeated with verbs:&mdash;&lsquo;the tree flies&rsquo; etc.,
and it functions as a key-word. It is difficult to decide whether this
part is a true <i lang="kij">tapwana</i> or only one of the not
infrequent examples of an <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i> with a
keyword.</p>
<p>Let us survey a few more of the <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i> (first
parts) of the canoe spells, and then proceed to the examination of the
middle parts and ends. In the next spell of <a href="#ch6">Chapter
VI</a>, the Kapitunena Duku spell, the word <i lang=
"kij">bavisivisi</i>, &lsquo;I shall wave them back,&rsquo; (that is;
the other canoes), is repeated ponderously several times. The opening
of a spell with one word, which summarises in a metaphorical manner the
aim of the spell is often found in Kiriwinian magic. In this spell
there follow the words:&mdash;</p>

<p>These words are pronounced with a heavy, thumping rhythm, as
indicated by the sharp and circumflex accents. The second line shows a
rhythmic and symmetrical arrangement of words. The remainder of the
<i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i> of this spell is similar to the same part
in the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> spell, which has been given here in
full native text (compare the free translations of both spells in

<p>This part of the <i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i> has not been
translated in the text, as its meaning is &lsquo;magical&rsquo; and can
be better grasped in connection with the native text. The word <i lang=
"kij">rayra&rsquo;i</i> is a magical word only. It is first given with
the antithetic opposition of the male and female prefixes <i lang=
"kij">vi-</i> and <i lang="kij">mo-</i>. The following phrase is a
typical example of a geographical antithesis. The two names refer to
the promontories facing one other across the sea passage Kaulokoki,
between Boyowa and Kayleula. Why those two points are mentioned I could
not find out.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="kij">kadumiyala</i> spell, given in <a href=
"#ch9">Chapter IX</a>, we have the following opening:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p lang="kij" class="first"><i lang="kij">Vinapega, pega; vinamwana,

nam mayouya&rsquo;i, makariyouya&rsquo;i, o&rsquo;u&rsquo;ula</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>In the first line, we have the symmetrically uttered and prefixed
names of the two flying or jumping fishes, <i lang="kij">pega</i> and
<i lang="kij">mwana</i>. The prefix <i lang="kij">vina-</i> is probably
the female prefix and may convey the meaning of flying&rsquo;s being
associated with women, that is with the flying witches. The second and
third verse contain a play on the root <i lang="kij">yova</i> or
<i lang="kij">yo&rsquo;u</i> &lsquo;to fly,&rsquo; reduplicated and
with several affixes added. These two verses are brought into a sort of
antithesis by the last two words, <i lang="kij">odabwana</i> and
<i lang="kij">o&rsquo;u&rsquo;ula</i>, or &lsquo;at the top,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;at the bottom,&rsquo; or here, probably, at the one end of the
canoe and at the other.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="kij">Bisila</i> spell, given in the same chapter, we
have the beginning:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">

</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The word <i lang="kij">bora&rsquo;i</i> seems to be again a purely
magical one. The prefix <i lang="kij">bo-</i> carries the meaning of
tabooed, or ritual; the root <i lang="kij">ra&rsquo;i</i> suggests
similarity with the above quoted magical word <i lang=
"kij">rayra&rsquo;i</i>, which is obviously merely a reduplicated form
of <i lang="kij">ra&rsquo;i</i>. This is therefore a rhythmically
constructed play on the magical root <i lang="kij">ra&rsquo;i</i>, and

"kij">teta</i>, &lsquo;to be poised<span class="corr" id="xd26e17523"
title="Not in source">,</span>&rsquo; &lsquo;to soar.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The <i lang="kij">Kayikuna veva</i> spell presents the following
rhythmic and symmetrical exordium:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446" name=

<p>The exact meaning of the two words is not quite clear, except that
they represent magical influences. Their arrangement and the antithesis
of <i lang="kij">olumwalela</i> (&lsquo;middle part,&rsquo;
&lsquo;inside&rsquo;), and <i lang="kij">katalena</i>
(&lsquo;body&rsquo; or &lsquo;outside&rsquo;) is in keeping with the

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The <i lang="kij">tapwana</i> (main parts) of the
spells, though they take a much longer time in reciting, are simpler in
construction. Many spells, moreover have no middle part at all. The
first regular <i lang="kij">tapwana</i> we find in our spells is that
in the Kapitunena Duku. There, we have a series of key-words recited
with a list of complimentary expressions. The key-words are verbs,
spoken in the form:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="intra"><span lang="kij" class=
"top">mata&rsquo;i,</span> <span lang="en-uk" class=

"top">meyova, etc.</span> <span lang="en-uk" class="bottom">fly,
etc.</span></span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>These verbs are used in this spell with the prefix <i lang=
"kij">ma-</i> or <i lang="kij">me-</i>, which represents the tense of
indefinite duration. This prefix, although, as far as I know, found in
several Melanesian languages in full vigour, has in Kiriwina a
distinctly archaic flavour, and is only used in certain locutions and
in magic. Some of the verbs used in this spell are metaphorical in
their meaning, describing the speed of the canoe in a figurative
manner. The list of the complimentary words repeated with the key-words
contains the enumeration of the different parts of the canoe. It is
typical that the key-words are in their form archaic and in their
meaning figurative while the complimentary terms are just ordinary
words of everyday speech.</p>
<p>Another regular <i lang="kij">tapwana</i> has been given in the
<i lang="kij">Kadumiyala</i> spell in <a href="#ch9">Chapter IX</a>,
where the only key-word, <i lang="kij">napuwoye</i>, has been
translated: &lsquo;I impart speed magically.&rsquo; The prefix <i lang=
"kij">na-</i> is that of the definite tense. The formative <i lang=
"kij">pu-</i> I was unable to translate, while the root <i lang=
"kij">woye</i> means literally &lsquo;to beat&rsquo; and in a somewhat
more remote sense, &lsquo;to impart magic.&rsquo; In the <i lang=
"kij">Kayikuna veva</i> spell, the pair <i lang="kij">bwoytalo&rsquo;i,
bosuyare</i>, meaning &lsquo;paint red in a ritual manner,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;wreathe in a ritual manner,&rsquo; are given formal resemblance
by the alliterative prefix <i lang="kij">bo-</i>, which carries with it
the meaning of &lsquo;ritual.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We see that the number of the <i lang="kij">tapwana</i> is smaller,
since only three spells out of seven have got it. In form, the <i lang=
"kij">tapwana</i> are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href=
"#pb447" name="pb447">447</a>]</span>simpler than the <i lang=
"kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>, and an examination of a greater number of
key-words would show that they also express directly or figuratively
the magical action or its effect<span class="corr" id="xd26e17648"
title="Source: ,">.</span> Thus, here we had a verb denoting the
imparting of magic, that is the direct expression of the action; then
two words figuratively expressing it, and the series of verbal
key-words enumerating the effects of the magic, such as flying, speed,
etc. In other canoe spells, not given in this book, there could be
found similar types of key-words such as: &lsquo;the canoe
flies&rsquo;; &lsquo;the <i lang="kij">buriwada</i> fish is poised on a
wave&rsquo;; &lsquo;the reef-heron wades&rsquo;; &lsquo;the reef-heron
skirts the beach&#8202;&hellip;&rsquo; all of them expressing the aim
of the spell in accordance with the magical trend of thought.</p>

<p class="first">From the linguistic point of view, the final parts of
the spells, the <i lang="kij">dogina</i>, present, as a rule, fewer
remarkable features. Phonetically the most outstanding trait is the
purely onomatopoetic sound complexes, such as <i lang="kij">sididi</i>
or <i lang="kij">saidididi</i>, or the three words <i lang=
"kij">sididi, tatata, numsa</i>, found in the <i lang=

are in some of the <i lang="kij">dogina</i> interesting metaphorical
turns of speech, such as the descriptions of time in the <i lang=

magician and his companions is expressed by allusions to the morning
and evening sun, couched in figurative speech. Some mythical allusions
also find their way into the <i lang="kij">dogina</i>. These parts of a
spell are <span class="corr" id="xd26e17685" title=

natives&rsquo; eyes; very often the same <i lang="kij">dogina</i> is
used with a number of formul&aelig; belonging to the one cycle, as we

instance, that of Kapitunena Duku, where the onomatopoetic sound
<i lang="kij">sidididi</i> stands for the whole <i lang=

more perfunctory, with fewer melodic modulations and phonetic
peculiarities.</p>

<p class="first">I have given so far a short linguistic survey of the
canoe spells, dealing first with their initial parts, <i lang=
"kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>, then with their main parts, <i lang=
"kij">tapwana</i>, and lastly saying a few words about the <i lang=

<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448" name=

magic) spells, quoted or mentioned in this book, beginning with the
<i lang="kij">u&rsquo;ula</i>.</p>
<p>In the <i lang="kij">Yawarapu</i> spell (<a href="#ch7">Chapter

<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">

</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Here the word <i lang="kij">bu&rsquo;a</i> (areca-nut) is repeated
and used as a prefix <i lang="kij">bo-</i>, with the antithetic roots
<i lang="kij">-vinay-</i> (female), and <i lang="kij">-mwanay-</i>
(male) and with the suffix <i lang="kij">-gu</i> (first possessive

<p>The <i lang="kij">Kaymwaloyo</i> (<a href="#ch7">Chapter VII</a>)
begins:&mdash;</p>

</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This is spoken in a solemn manner, and then follows the play on the
root <i lang="kij">mwase</i>, described above in the free translation
of this spell.</p>
<p>Another rhythmic beginning, spoken with regular, strongly marked
accent is to be found in the <i lang="kij">Kaykakaya</i> spell

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The main parts of the spells in the magic of the Kula
do not essentially differ in their characteristics from the <i lang=
"kij">tapwana</i> of the canoe magic. In their form, some key-words are
simply verbs used without any transformation in their narrative tense.
Thus in the <i lang="kij">Talo</i> (red paint) formula, the pair of
verbs <i lang="kij">ikata</i> (&lsquo;it flares up&rsquo;), <i lang=
"kij">inamila</i> (&lsquo;it flashes&rsquo;) is used with various nouns
describing parts of the human head. The key-words of the <i lang=
"kij">Kayikuna Tabuyo</i> (<a href="#ch13">Chapter XIII</a>) are also
grammatically simple: <i lang="kij">buribwari, kuvakaku kuvakipusa</i>
(&lsquo;fish-hawk, fall on thy prey, catch it&rsquo;)&mdash;the verbs
being in the second person of the narrative tense.</p>
<p>In other cases we find the key-word transformed by reduplication,
composition or by affixes. In the Yawarapu spell (<a href=
"#ch7">Chapter VII</a>) the pair <i lang="kij">boraytupa,
badederuma</i> repeated as key expressions is a compound which I did
not succeed in analysing completely, though the consensus of my
informants makes me satisfied with the approximate
translation:&mdash;&lsquo;Quick sailing, abundant haul.&rsquo; In the
<i lang="kij">Gebobo</i> spell (<a href="#ch7">Chapter VII</a>) the
expression <i lang="kij">tutube tubeyama</i> is a play on the root
<i lang="kij">tubwo</i> used as a rule verbally and meaning &lsquo;to
be full in the face,&rsquo; &lsquo;to be fine looking.&rsquo; In the
<i lang="kij">Ta&rsquo;uya</i> spell (<a href="#ch13">Chapter XIII</a>)
there is the reduplication <i lang="kij">munumweynise</i> of the root
<i lang="kij">mwana</i> or <i lang="kij">mwayna</i> expressing the
&lsquo;itching&rsquo; or &lsquo;state of excitement.&rsquo; In the
<i lang="kij">ka&rsquo;ubanai</i> the first key-expression <i lang=
"kij">ida dabara</i> is an archaic or dialectical couple (the root is
<i lang="kij">dabara</i>, and <i lang="kij">ida</i> is only a phonetic
addition), which signifies &lsquo;to ebb.&rsquo; The other
key-expressions &lsquo;<i lang="kij">ka&rsquo;ukwa yaruyaru,&rsquo;
&lsquo;ka&rsquo;ukwa mwasara,&rsquo; &lsquo;ka&rsquo;ukwa mwasara
baremwasemwasara</i>&rsquo; have all the verbal part irregularly
reduplicated and in the last expression repeated and transformed. The
last formula of the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> (Kula magic) given in
<a href="#ch14">Chapter XIV</a>, has a pair of expressions used as
key-phrase: &lsquo;<i lang="kij">kwoygapani, pani;
kwoyga&rsquo;ulu</i>, ulu.&rsquo; The word <i lang="kij">kwega</i>, a
variety of betel plant, is used in a modified form as a prefix and
compounded with the verbal roots <i lang="kij">pani</i> (seduce) and
<i lang="kij">ulu</i> (enmesh).</p>
<p>As to the final parts of this class of spell, I have said before
that it is much less variable than the initial and main parts of a
formula. Within the same cycle or system, the <i lang="kij">dogina</i>
often varies little and a man will often use the same one with all his
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name=
"pb450">450</a>]</span>spells. The sample given with the <i lang=
"kij">sulumwoya</i> text will therefore be sufficient to show the
various characteristics of this part of the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i>
spell, and there is no need to say anything more about it.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A very rapid survey of the phonetic characters of the
<i lang="kij">kayga&rsquo;u</i> spells (<a href="#ch11">Chapter XI</a>)
must be sufficient and we shall confine ourselves to their <i lang=
"kij">tapwana</i>. The word <i lang="kij">gwa&rsquo;u</i> or <i lang=
"kij">ga&rsquo;u</i> means &lsquo;mist&rsquo; or &lsquo;fog&rsquo;;
verbally used with the meaning &lsquo;to make mist&rsquo; &lsquo;to
befog,&rsquo; it has always the form <i lang="kij">ga&rsquo;u</i>. In
the main parts of some of the formul&aelig; of this class, this
phonetically very expressive word is used with very great sound effect.
For example in the <i lang="kij">giyorokaywa</i> spell No. 1, the
key-words are <i lang="kij">aga&rsquo;u</i> (&lsquo;I befog&rsquo;),
<i lang="kij">aga&rsquo;usulu</i> (&lsquo;I befog, lead astray&rsquo;);
<i lang="kij">aga&rsquo;uboda</i> (&lsquo;I befog, shut off&rsquo;).
Spoken, at the beginning of the <i lang="kij">tapwana</i> slowly and
sonorously, and then quickly and insistently these words produce a
really &lsquo;magical&rsquo; effect&mdash;that is as far as the
hearers&rsquo; subjective impressions are concerned. Even more
impressive and onomatopoetic is the phrase used as key-expression in
the <i lang="kij">Giyotanawa</i> No. 2:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><i lang="kij">Ga&rsquo;u, yaga&rsquo;u,
yagaga&rsquo;u, yaga&rsquo;u, bode, bodegu!</i></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence, giving the vowels a full Italian value, such as they
receive in the Melanesian pronunciation, does certainly have an
impressive ring; fittingly enough, because this is the dramatic spell,
uttered into the wind in the sinking <i lang="kij">waga</i>, the final
effort of magic to blind and mislead the <i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i>.
The causative prefix <i lang="kij">ya<span class="corr" id="xd26e18059"
title="Not in source">-</span></i> is used here with a nominal
expression <i lang="kij">yaga&rsquo;u</i> which has been translated
&lsquo;gathering mist&rsquo;; the reduplicated one <i lang=
"kij">yagaga&rsquo;u</i> I have rendered by &lsquo;encircling
mist.&rsquo; It can be seen from this example how feebly the
equivalents can be given of the magical phrases in which so much is
expressed by phonetic or onomatopoetic means.</p>
<p>The other spells have much less inspired key-words. <i lang=
"kij">Giyotanawa</i> No. 1 uses the word <i lang="kij">atumboda</i>,
translated &lsquo;I press,&rsquo; &lsquo;I close down,&rsquo; which
literally renders the meanings of the verbs <i lang="kij">tum</i>,
&lsquo;to press,&rsquo; and <i lang="kij">boda</i>, &lsquo;to
close.&rsquo; The <i lang="kij">Giyorokaywa</i> No. 2 has the somewhat
archaic key-words spoken in a couple: &lsquo;<i lang="kij">apeyra
yauredi</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;I arise,&rsquo; &lsquo;I escape&rsquo; and
the grammatically irregular expression <i lang="kij">suluya</i>,
&lsquo;to lead astray.&rsquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451"
href="#pb451" name="pb451">451</a>]</span></p>
<p>The main part of the Kaytaria spell, by which the benevolent fish is
summoned to the rescue of the drowning party has the key-phrase
&lsquo;<i lang="kij">bigabaygu suyusayu</i>: the <i lang=
"kij">suyusayu</i> fish shall lift me up.&rsquo; This expression is
noteworthy: even in this spell, which might be regarded as an
invocation of the helpful animal, it is not addressed in the second
person. The result is verbally anticipated, proving that the spell is
to act through the direct force of the words and not as an appeal to
the animal.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">With this, the survey of linguistic samples from
various spells is closed, and we can briefly summarise our results. The
belief in the efficiency of a formula results in various peculiarities
of the language in which it is couched, both as regards meaning and
sound. The native is deeply convinced of this mysterious, intrinsic
power of certain words; words which are believed to have their virtue
in their own right, so to speak; having come into existence from
primeval times and exercising their influence directly.</p>
<p>To start first with the meaning of the magical expressions, we have
seen that in this respect they are plain and direct enough. Most of the
key-words simply state the magical action, for example when in one of
the spells the key-word napuwoye, &lsquo;I impart magical virtue (of
speed<span class="corr" id="xd26e18108" title=
"Source: &rsquo;),">),&rsquo;</span> or in another the key-words
&lsquo;to paint red in a festive manner, to wreathe in a festive
manner,&rsquo; simply describe what the magician is doing. Much more
often the principal expressions, that is the initial words and the
key-words, of a spell refer to its aim, as for instance, when we find
words and phrases denoting &lsquo;speed&rsquo; in canoe magic; or, in
Kula magic, designations for &lsquo;success&rsquo; &lsquo;abundant
haul,&rsquo; &lsquo;excitement,&rsquo; &lsquo;beauty.&rsquo; Still more
often the aim of magic is stated in a metaphorical manner, by similes
and double meanings. In other parts of the spell, where the magical
meaning is imprisoned not so much in single words and expressions, as
in explicit phraseology and long periods, we found that the predominant
features are: lists of ancestral names; invocations of ancestral
spirits; mythological allusions; similes and exaggerations;
depreciating contrasts between the companions and the
reciter&mdash;most of them expressing an anticipation of the favourable
results aimed at in the spell. Again, certain parts of the spell
contain systematic, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452"
name="pb452">452</a>]</span>meticulous enumerations, the reciter going
over the parts of a canoe one by one; the successive stages of a
journey; the various Kula goods and valuables; the parts of the human
head; the numerous places from which the flying witches are believed to
come. Such enumerations as a rule strive at an almost pedantic
completeness.</p>
<p>Passing to the phonetic characteristics, we saw that a word will
often be used in a shape quite different from those in which it is used
in ordinary speech; that it will show notable changes in form and
sound. Such phonetic peculiarities are most conspicuous in the main
words, that is in the key-words and initial words. They are sometimes
truncated, more often provided with additions, such as symmetrical or
antithetic affixes; formatives added for the sake of sound. By these
means there are produced effects of rhythm, alliteration and rhyme,
often heightened and accentuated by actual vocal accent. We found play
on words by symmetrical couples of sounds, with antithetic meaning like
<i lang="kij">mo-</i> and <i lang="kij">vi-</i>, or <i lang=
"kij">mwana-</i> and <i lang="kij">vina-</i>, both couples signifying
&lsquo;male&rsquo; and &lsquo;female&rsquo; respectively; or <i lang=
"kij">-mugwa</i> (ancient) and <i lang="kij">-va&rsquo;u</i> (new); or
<i lang="kij">ma-</i> (hither) and <i lang="kij">wa-</i> (thither),
etc., etc. Especially we found the prefix <i lang="kij">bo-</i>,
carrying the meaning of ritual or tabooed, with derivation from
<i lang="kij">bomala</i>; or with the meaning &lsquo;red,&rsquo;
&lsquo;festive&rsquo; in its derivation from <i lang=
"kij">bu&rsquo;a</i> (areca-nut); onomatopoetic sounds such as <i lang=
"kij">sididi</i> or <i lang="kij">saydidi, tatata, numsa</i>, in
imitation of speed noises, of the wailing of wind, rustling of sail,
swish of pandanus leaves; <i lang="kij">tududu</i>, in imitation of the
thunder claps; and the rhythmical, expressive, though perhaps not
directly onomatopoetic, sentence:</p>
<blockquote>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If we now turn to the substances used in the magical
rites, as means of ritual transference of the spell, we find in canoe
magic, dried lalang grass, dried banana leaf, dried pandanus leaf, all
used in the magic of lightness. A stale potato is employed to carry
away the heaviness of the canoe; although on another occasion heaviness
is thrown away with a bunch of lalang grass. The leaves of two or three
shrubs and weeds, which as a rule the natives take to dry their skin
after bathing, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name=
"pb453">453</a>]</span>are used for magical cleansing of a canoe body,
and a stick and a torch serve in other rites of exorcism. In the rite
associated with the blackening of a canoe, charred remains of several
light substances such as lalang grass, the nest of a small, swift bird,
the wings of a bat, coco-nut husk and the twigs of an extremely light
mimosa tree are employed.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that, not less than the words, the substances here
used are associated with the aim of the magic, that is, with lightness,
with swiftness and with flying.</p>
<p>In the magic of the Kula we find betel-nut, crushed with lime in a
mortar, used to redden the tip of the canoe. Betel-nut is also given to
a partner, after it has been charmed over with a seducing spell.
Aromatic mint, boiled in coco-nut oil and ginger root are also used in
the <i lang="kij">mwasila</i>. The conch-shell, and the cosmetic
ingredients, charmed over on Sarubwoyna beach are really part of the
outfit, and so is the <i lang="kij">lilava</i> bundle. All the
substances used in this magic are associated either with beauty and
attractiveness (betel-nut, cosmetics, the mint plant) or with
excitement (conch-shell, chewed betel-nut). Here therefore, it is not
with the final aim&mdash;which is the obtaining of valuables&mdash;that
the magic is concerned, but with the intermediate one, that is that of
being agreeable to one&rsquo;s partner, of putting him into a state of
excitement about the Kula.</p>

<p class="first">I wish to close this chapter by adducing a few texts
of native information. In the previous chapters, several statements and
narratives have been put into the natives&rsquo; mouths and given in
quotations. I wish now to show some of the actual linguistic data from
which such quotations have been derived. Numerous utterances of the
natives were taken down by me as they were spoken. Whenever there was a
native expression covering a point of crucial importance, or a
characteristic thought, or one neatly formulated, or else one
especially hazy and opalescent in meaning&mdash;I noted them down in
quick handwriting as they were spoken. A number of such texts, apart
from their linguistic importance, will serve as documents embodying the
native ideas without any foreign admixture, and it will also show the
long way which lies between the crude native statement and its
explicit, ethnographic presentation. For what strikes us at first sight
most forcibly in these texts is their <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb454" href="#pb454" name="pb454">454</a>]</span>extreme bareness, the
scantiness of information which they appear to contain. Couched in a
condensed, disjointed, one might say telegraphic style, they seem to
lack almost everything which could throw light on the subject of our
study. For they lack concatenation of ideas, and they contain few
concrete details, and few really apt generalisations. It must be
remembered, however, that, whatever might be the importance of such
texts, they are not the only source of ethnographic information, not
even the most important one. The observer has to read them in the
context of tribal life. Many of the customs of behaviour, of the
sociological data, which are barely mentioned in the texts, have become
familiar to the Ethnographer through personal observation and the
direct study of the objective manifestations and of data referring to
their social constitution (compare the observations on Method in the
Introduction). On the other hand, a better knowledge of and
acquaintance with the means of linguistic expression makes the language
itself much more significant to one who not only knows how it is used
but uses it himself. After all, if natives could furnish us with
correct, explicit and consistent accounts of their tribal organisation,
customs and ideas, there would be no difficulty in ethnographic work.
Unfortunately, the native can neither get outside his tribal
atmospheres and see it objectively, nor if he could, would he have
intellectual and linguistic means sufficient to express it. And so the
Ethnographer has to collect objective data, such as maps, plans,
genealogies, lists of possessions, accounts of inheritance, censuses of
village communities. He has to study the behaviour of the native, to
talk with him under all sorts of conditions, and to write down his
words. And then, from all these diverse data, to construct his
synthesis, the picture of a community and of the individuals in it. But
I have dwelt on these aspects of method already in the Introduction and
here I want only to exemplify them with regard to the linguistic
material directly representing some of the natives&rsquo; thoughts on
ethnographic subjects.</p>

<p class="first">I shall give here first a text on the subject of the
priority in sailing, which as described in <a href="#ch9">Chapter
IX</a>, is the privilege of a certain sub-clan in Sinaketa. I was
discussing with a very <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href=

Sinaketa, the customs of launching the canoes, and I tried, as usually,
to keep my interlocutor as much as possible to concrete details and to
the stating of the full sequence of events. In his account he uttered
this sentence:</p>

<p>The verbal translation renders word for word the individual meaning
of every particle and root, according to a definite grammatical and
lexicographical scheme which has been adopted for this text in common
with a few hundred more. In this place, I cannot give the commentary
and justification of the linguistic details, which will be fairly
obvious to a Melanesian scholar, who might, however, find some new and
even controversial features in my translation. To other readers, these
details are of small interest. I have not included in this translation
any distinction between the inclusive and exclusive first person, dual
and plural. Of the two tenses which are to be found in this text, the
narrative one is translated by the English verb in infinitive, the
potential, by the addition of the word &lsquo;might.&rsquo; In brackets
underneath, the special meaning of a word in its context is indicated,
or some comments are added.</p>
<p>The free translation of the text must now be given:&mdash;</p>

<p>1 The Tolabwaga canoe would be launched first; by this the face of
the sea is cleared.</p>
<p>2 Afterwards, all the chiefs&rsquo;, the commoners&rsquo; canoes are
launched.</p>
<p>3 If we would launch our canoes first, the spirits (of ancestors)
would be angry with us; we would go to Dobu and we would receive no
pigs, no necklaces.</p>
<p>4 It is likewise with the lashing of the canoe: first, the Tolabwaga
would bind the lashing creeper and afterwards ourselves.</p>
<p>5 On our journey to Dobu, the Tolabwaga would not sail ahead, for
their priority ends on the beach of Sinaketa.</p>
<p>6 On the sea it is according to our wish, and if one man&rsquo;s
canoe runs fast, he would be first.</p>
<p>7 They (the Tolabwaga) do not wield the command of the canoe fleet.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb458" href="#pb458" name=

<p>8 In Dobu, the chiefs would be first; the chiefs would arrive there
at the head of the fleet.</p>
<p>9 But the supremacy of the Tolabwaga ends here already, in the
village.</p>
<p>10 The Kula magic, the magic of the canoe, belonging to the
Tolabwaga clan has passed already into the hands of their
womenfolk.</p>
<p>11 (These would say speaking to their male children): &mdash;
&ldquo;We shall give you the magic, the magical inheritance, you rule
henceforward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>12 When the spirits become angry, they would tell us:&mdash;
&ldquo;Why are the Tolabwaga not first and you minor chiefs are ahead?
Are not the Tolabwaga cleaners of the sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>13 When we do wrong, they (the spirits) are angry, their minds are
malevolent, for they desire that we should keep to the old customs.</p>

<p class="first">Comparing the free translation with the literal one,
it is easy to see that certain additions have been made, sentences have
been subordinated and co-ordinated by various English conjunctions
which are either completely absent from the native text, or else
represented by such very vague particles as <i lang="kij">boge</i>
(already), and <i lang="kij">m&rsquo;tage</i> (indeed). On these
linguistic questions I cannot enlarge here, but it will be good to go
over each sentence in succession, and to show how much it was necessary
to add from the general store of sociological and ethnographic
knowledge, in order to make it intelligible.</p>
<p>1. The meaning of the word &lsquo;fall down&rsquo; is specialised
here by the context, and I translated it by &lsquo;launch.&rsquo; The
particle <i lang="kij">boge</i> had to be translated here by &lsquo;by
this.&rsquo; The words about the &lsquo;clearing of the sea&rsquo;
suggested at once to me that there was a special ancient custom in
question. Then there is the name of the sub-clan Tolabwaga. In order to
understand the full meaning of this phrase, it is necessary to realise
that this name stands for a sub-clan; and then one has to be well
acquainted with native sociology, in order to grasp what such a
privilege, vested in a sub-clan, might mean. Thus, a word like this can
in the first place be understood only in the context of its phrase, and
on the basis of a certain linguistic knowledge. But its fuller meaning
becomes intelligible only in the context of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href="#pb459" name=
"pb459">459</a>]</span>native life and of native sociology. Again the
expression referring to the clearing of the sea required a further
comment, for which I asked my informant, and was answered by Phrase
3.</p>
<p>2. In this phrase the expressions &lsquo;chiefs,&rsquo;
&lsquo;commoners&rsquo; etc., are fully intelligible only to one, who
has a definition of these words in terms of native sociology. Indeed,
only the knowledge of the usual supremacy of the chiefs allows one to
gauge their importance and the survival character of this custom, by
which this importance is diminished for a time.</p>
<p>3. Here, we have the explanation of the obscure clause in phrase 1,
&lsquo;A clear sea&rsquo; means the good temper of the spirits which
again means good luck. The question as to whether the spirits are to be
imagined as actively interfering or helping still remained open. I
asked for a further elucidation, which was given to me in the text of
Phrases 12 and 13.</p>
<p>4. This contains a condensed reference to the stages of
ship-building, previous to launching. This, of course, to be
understood, pre-supposes a knowledge of these various activities.</p>
<p>5 to 9. The limitations of the powers of the Tolabwaga sub-clan are
outlined, giving interesting side-lights on the r&ocirc;le played by
females as repositories of family (sub-clan) traditions. Needless to
say, this statement would be entirely meaningless without the knowledge
of the natives&rsquo; matrilineal institutions, of their customs of
inheritance and of property in magic. The correct knowledge of these
facts can only be gathered by a collection of objective, ethnographic
documents, such as concrete data about cases of actual inheritance,
etc.</p>
<p>12 and 13. Here it is explained how far the <i lang="kij">baloma</i>
would become angry and how they would act if a custom were broken. It
can be distinctly seen from it that the anger of the spirits is only a
phrase, covering all these forces which keep the natives to the
observance of old customs. The <i lang="kij">baloma</i> would go no
further than to reproach them for breaking the old rules, and there are
no definite ideas among these natives about actual punishment being
meted out by offended spirits.</p>
<p>These considerations show convincingly that no linguistic analysis
can disclose the full meaning of a text without the help of an adequate
knowledge of the sociology, of the customs and of the beliefs, current
in a given society.</p>

<p class="first">Another sample of a native text may be given here, as
it is of especial interest, in that it throws light upon the previously
given magical formula of the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i>. It is the text I
obtained trying to find the meaning of the word <i lang=
"kij">bosisi&rsquo;ula</i>, which figures at the beginning of the
above-mentioned spell. According to two informants of Sinaketa, the
word <i lang="kij">visisi&rsquo;una</i> refers to the belief already
described, that the owner of a <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> charm is liable
to fits of trembling, during which he trembles as a <i lang=
"kij">bisila</i> (pandanus) streamer trembles in the wind. He then
should ritually eat some baked fish, and this is called <i lang=
"kij">visisi&rsquo;una</i>. Such a man would then ask somebody of his
household:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i lang="kij">Kugabu, kumaye,
avisisi&rsquo;una</i>.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Thou bake, thou bring, I ritually eat.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Or someone else would urge his wife or daughter:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i lang="kij">Kugabu, kumaye,
ivisisi&rsquo;una</i>.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Thou bake, thou bring, he eats ritually.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, asked for a direct equation, my informant said:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;<i lang="kij">Ivisisi&rsquo;una &mdash; bigabu,
tomwaya ikam</i>.&rdquo;<br>
&ldquo;Ivisisi&rsquo;una &mdash; he bake, old man he eat.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The following text contains a more explicit definition of the term,
which I was trying at that time to make clear and to translate by an
appropriate English expression.</p>

<p>This text, with its foregoing short comments and with its two
versions will give an inkling of how I was able to obtain from my
native informants the definition of unknown and sometimes very involved
expressions and how, in the act of doing it, I was given additional
enlightenment on obscure details of belief and custom.</p>
<p>It will also be interesting to give another text referring to the
<i lang="kij">gwara</i> custom. I have given in <a href="#ch14">Chapter
XIV</a> a native definition of this custom, and of the reception
accorded to the Trobrianders in Dobu when there is a taboo on palms
there. The statement was based on the following text, and on certain
other additional notes.</p>

<p>1 We come to Dobu, (there) someone has recently died&mdash;there is
a gwala: the areca nut will ripen, the bananas will ripen, they will
stick up coco-nuts on small spikes.</p>
<p>2 If there is no ka&rsquo;ubana&rsquo;i charm made&mdash;we are
afraid: they (sc. the Dobuans) put on war paint, take up spear and axe,
they sit (waiting) and look at us.</p>
<p>3 We go into the village running, not walking; we arrive and climb
the areca palm. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb463" href="#pb463"
name="pb463">463</a>]</span></p>
<p>4 He (the Dobuan) shouts: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t climb the areca
palm!&rdquo;</p>
<p>5 Already he takes the spear, so as to hit us.</p>
<p>6 We ritually spit about wild ginger root charmed with the
ka&rsquo;ubana&rsquo;i spell&mdash;he returns, comes to us, laughs, he
throws away spear and axe.</p>
<p>7 We ritually bespit the whole village, already their intention
vanishes, they tell us:</p>
<p>8 &ldquo;Well, climb your areca palm and your coco-nut, cut your
banana.&rdquo;</p>
<p>9 If no kinsman had died, their intentions are good.</p>
<p>10 A woman would also take up a spear, as they (the Dobuans) are
cannibals.</p>
<p>These three texts will be quite sufficient to give an idea of the
method of dealing with linguistic evidence, and of the documentary
value of immediately recorded native opinions. They will also make
clear what I have said before, that only a good, working knowledge of a
native language on the one hand, and a familiarity with their social
organisation and tribal life on the other, would make it possible to
read all the full significance into these texts. <span class=

<p class="first">After the somewhat long digression on magic, we can
now return once more to the description of the Kula. So far, we have
been treating only one incident in it, the overseas expedition between
Sinaketa and Dobu, and the return visit. But in dealing with this one
typical stage we have received a picture of the whole Kula, and we have
incidentally learnt all about the fundamentals of the exchange, the
magic, the mythology, and the other associated aspects. Now it remains
to put the finishing touches to the general picture, that is, to say a
few words, first about the manner in which it is conducted within a
district, and then to follow the exchange on the remaining part of the
ring. The exchange within each Kula community has been called the
&lsquo;inland Kula.&rsquo; This part of the subject I know from
personal experience in the Trobriands only. All that will be said
therefore in this chapter will apply primarily to that part of the
ring. As Boyowa, however, is by far the biggest and most densely
populated piece of land within the Kula, it is clear that in treating
the inland exchange in that island, we treat it in its most developed
and typical form.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned before, in <a href="#ch16">Chapter XVI</a>
that in April, 1918, To&rsquo;uluwa had come to Sinaketa in connection
with the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> visit of the Dobuans. To&rsquo;uluwa
is the present chief of Omarakana, indeed, the last chief of Kiriwina,
for after his death no one will succeed him. His power has been broken
by the interference of Government officials and the influence of
Mission work. The power of the Trobriand chief lay mainly in his
wealth, and this he was able to keep constantly at a high level through
the institution of polygamy. Now that he is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb465" href="#pb465" name=
"pb465">465</a>]</span>forbidden to acquire more wives, though he may
keep his old ones; and now that his successor will not be allowed to
follow this immemorial custom of polygamy practised by their dynasty,
the power of the chief has no basis, and has to a great extent
collapsed.</p>
<p>I may add that this interference, inflicted for no comprehensible
purposes, except if it be an exceedingly parochial and narrow-minded
application of our sense of morality and propriety, has no legal basis
whatever in the regulations of that Colony, and could not be justified
either formally or on account of any results it may produce. Indeed,
the undermining of old-established authority, of tribal morals and
customs tends on the one hand completely to demoralise the natives and
to make them unamenable to any law or rule, while on the other hand, by
destroying the whole fabric of tribal life, it deprives them of many of
their most cherished diversions, ways of enjoying life, and social
pleasures. Now once you make life unattractive for a man, whether
savage or civilised, you cut the taproot of his vitality. The rapid
dying out of native races is, I am deeply convinced, due more to wanton
interference with their pleasures and normal occupations, to the
marring of their joy of life as they conceive it, than to any other
cause. In the Trobriands, for instance, the chief has always been the
organiser of all the big, tribal festivities. He received large
contributions from the commoners under various legal obligations (see
<a href="#div6.6">Chap. VI, Division VI</a>) but he gave away all his
wealth again in the form of big, ceremonial distributions, of presents
at festivities, of food gifts to the partakers in dances, tribal sports
and diversions. These were the pleasures in which the natives found
real zest, which largely gave meaning to their lives. Nowadays all
these pursuits have greatly slackened, because of the lack of
concentration of wealth and power in the chief&rsquo;s hands. He can
neither afford to finance the big pastimes of yore, nor has he
influence enough to give the same energetic initiative to start them
going. After his death, things will be worse still. There are reasons
to fear, and even natives express their misgivings, that in a
generation or two the Kula will become entirely disorganised.</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that the resistance and health of a native
depend on auto-suggestion more even than is the case with ourselves,
though new developments in psychotherapy <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb466" href="#pb466" name="pb466">466</a>]</span>seem to indicate that
medicine has up till now largely underrated the general influence of
this factor. Even the old ethnographic observers, more in Polynesia
perhaps than anywhere else, have reported clear, unmistakable instances
in which the loss of interest in life and the determination to die
brought about death without any other cause. My own experience, though
I have no one very striking case to cite, bears this out fully from all
sorts of corroborating types of evidence. It is therefore not going
beyond what is fully granted by facts, to maintain that a general loss
of interest in life, of the <i lang="fr">joie de vivre</i>, the cutting
of all the bonds of intense interest, which bind members of a human
community to existence, will result in their giving up the desire to
live altogether, and that therefore they will fall an easy prey to any
disease, as well as fail to multiply.</p>
<p>A wise administration of natives would, on the one hand, try to
govern <i>through</i> the chief, using his authority along the lines of
old law, usage, and custom; on the other hand it would try to maintain
all which really makes life worth living for the natives, for it is the
most precious inheritance, which they have from the past ages, and it
is no good to try to substitute other interests for those lost. It is
easy to hand over one&rsquo;s vices to a man racially and culturally
different; but nothing is as difficult to impart as a keen interest in
the sports and amusements of other people. Even from one European
nation to another, the last stronghold of national peculiarity can be
found in its traditional diversions, and without diversion and
amusement a culture and a race cannot survive. The application of a
heavy, indeed, crushing machinery of European law and moral
regulations, with their various sanctions, simply destroys the whole
delicate fabric of tribal authority, eradicating good and bad alike,
and leaves nothing but anarchy, bewilderment and ill will.<a class=

<p>With a mere show of his former authority, therefore, poor old
To&rsquo;uluwa arrived with a handful of followers at Sinaketa. He
still keeps to all the strict observances and onerous duties with which
his exalted position was weighted in olden days. Thus, he may not
partake of ever so many kinds of food, considered to be unclean for the
members of the sub-clan of Tabalu. He may not even touch any defiled
objects, that have been in contact with unclean food; he may not eat
from dishes or drink out of vessels which have been used previously by
other people. When he goes to Sinaketa, for instance, where even the
highest chiefs do not keep the taboos, he remains almost on starvation
diet; he can only eat the food which has been brought from his own
village, or drink and eat green coco-nut. Of the honours attaching to
his position, not many are observed. In olden days, on his approach to
a village, a runner would enter first, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb468" href="#pb468" name="pb468">468</a>]</span>and in a loud voice
cry out &ldquo;<i lang="kij">O Guya&rsquo;u</i>,&rdquo; whereupon all
the people would stand in readiness, and at the chief&rsquo;s approach
the commoners would throw themselves on the ground, the headman would
squat down, and men of rank would bend their heads. Even now, no
commoner in the Trobriands would stand erect in the presence of
To&rsquo;uluwa. But he no more announces his arrival in such a loud and
proud manner, and he takes his dues as they are given, not demanding
them with any show of authority.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">On that occasion in Sinaketa, I met him again after
about two years interval since the time when I lived as his neighbour
in Omarakana for some eight months, my tent pitched side by side with
his <i lang="kij">lisiga</i> (chief&rsquo;s man&rsquo;s abode). I found
him changed and aged, his tall figure more bent, his large face, with
its expression half of benevolence and half of cunning, wrinkled and
clouded over. He had some grievances to tell about the offhand
treatment which had been given to him in Sinaketa, where he had
received no necklaces at all, although a few days before the Sinaketans
had carried from Kiriwina over 150 pairs of armshells. Indeed, the
relative change of position between the chiefs of Sinaketa and himself
is a permanent sore point with the old chief. All coastal natives, and
especially the headman of Sinaketa, have become very rich owing to the
introduced industry of pearling, where their services are paid for by
the white men in tobacco, betel-nut, and <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>. But To&rsquo;uluwa, ruined through white
man&rsquo;s influence, receives nothing from pearling, and compared to
his Sinaketan inferiors, is a pauper. So after a day or two in
Sinaketa, highly displeased, and vowing never to return again, he went
back to Omarakana, his residence, and thither we shall follow him.</p>
<p>For Omarakana is still the centre of the Trobriand inland Kula, and,
in certain respects, still one of the most important places on the
ring. It is probably the only locality where the Kula is or ever was to
some extent concentrated in the hands of one man, and it is also the
capital of the important district of Kiriwina, which dominates all the
inland Kula of the Northern Trobriands, and links up the island of
Kitava with the western islands of Kuyleula and Kuyawa. It is also an
important link <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb469" href="#pb469" name=
"pb469">469</a>]</span>between Kitava and Sinaketa, though between
these two last mentioned places there are some minor means of
communication, as we shall presently see.</p>
<p>Previously, in <a href="#ch3">Chapter III</a>, in the definition of
the fundamentals of the Kula, we saw that the population of the Ring
can be divided into what we called <i>Kula communities</i>. These
divisions, as we remember, were distinguished by the fact that each one
makes overseas expeditions of its own. For example, the Sinaketans, as
we saw, make their trips to Dobu in a body, and although the Vakutans
may go with them at the same time, the two fleets sail and act as
independent units. Again, the whole district of Kiriwina sails to the
East, to Kitava, as one fleet. But no Sinaketan canoe could ever form
part of it. Another distinguishing characteristic of a Kula community
is that the furthest limits of partnership are the same for all its
members. Thus for instance, a man from any village in Kiriwina,
provided he is in the Kula, may have a partner anywhere up to the
furthest limits of the Sinaketa district in the South, and in any of
the villages of the island of Kitava to the East. But beyond that, no
Kiriwinian, not even To&rsquo;uluwa himself, can enter into Kula
partnership. There are again certain differences between the manner of
conducting transactions within a Kula community on the one hand, and
between members of two communities on the other.</p>
<p>Kiriwina is one of such Kula communities, and Sinaketa is another.
Yet the two are not divided by sea, and the style of exchange, when
this is carried on between two Kula communities which lie in the same
district, differs also from that of overseas Kula. Our first task here
will be therefore to mark out clearly the lines of distinction
between:</p>
<p>1. The transactions of Kula carried on overseas, from one district
to another.</p>
<p>2. Kula between two distinct but contiguous &lsquo;Kula
communities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>3. Transactions within a &lsquo;Kula community.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The facts belonging to the first heading have been described at
length, and it will be enough to point out in what the second type
differs from the first. Obviously, when two districts on the same
island, such as Kiriwina and Sinaketa, make the exchange there is no
overseas sailing, no preparation of canoes, no launching, no <i lang=
"kij">kabigidoya</i>. Sometimes big joint expeditions <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb470" href="#pb470" name="pb470">470</a>]</span>are
made by the one community to the other and a great haul of <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> is carried home. As an example of that, we may
mention the visit made by the Sinaketans to Kiriwina in the last days
of March, 1918, when a great number of <i lang="kij">mwali</i> were
brought, in readiness for the Dobuan <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> visit.
When such an important visit is made from one Trobriand district to
another, some of the Kula magic will be performed, but obviously not
all, for there is no <i lang="kij">lilava</i> bundle to be medicated,
since no trade is carried; no dangerous cannibals have to be tamed by
the <i lang="kij">ka&rsquo;ubana&rsquo;i</i> rite, for the hosts are,
and always have been, friendly neighbours. But some of the beauty
magic, and the enticing formula over <span class="corr" id="xd26e20206"
title="Source: betel nut">betel-nut</span> would be recited to obtain
as many valuables as possible. There is nothing corresponding to
<i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> in such big visits between neighbouring
districts, though I think that they would be held only in connection
with some <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> visit from another part of the ring
to one of the two districts, as was the case in the example quoted,
that is the Sinaketan visit to Kiriwina (<a href="#ch16">Chapter
XVI</a>). Of course there is no associated trade on such expeditions,
for there is very little to exchange between Sinaketa and Kiriwina, and
what there is, is done independently, in a regular manner all the year
round. Partnership between people of such two Kula communities is very
much the same as within one of them. It obtains between people speaking
the same language, having the same customs and institutions, many of
whom are united by bonds of actual kinship or relationship-in-law. For,
as has been mentioned already, marriages between Sinaketa and Kiriwina
take place frequently, especially between natives of high rank. The
rule is, in such cases, that a man of Sinaketa marries a woman of
Kiriwina.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Let us pass now to the relation between categories 2
and 3, that is between Kula of two contiguous &lsquo;Kula
communities,&rsquo; and the Kula within one of them. First of all, in
the inland Kula within the same community, there never take place big,
wholesale transactions. The circulation of <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> consists of individual exchanges, sometimes
more frequent, that is, whenever an overseas expedition has come home
laden with many valuables, sometimes done at long intervals. No magic
is <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb471" href="#pb471" name=
"pb471">471</a>]</span>performed in this type of Kula, and though there
is a certain amount of ceremony accompanying each gift, there are no
big, public gatherings. A concrete description of an actual case may
serve best to illustrate these general statements.</p>
<p>During the eight months I stayed in Omarakana in 1915&ndash;1916, I
had the opportunity of watching many cases of inland Kula, as there was
a constant come and go between Kiriwina and Kitava, and subsequent to
each influx of armshells from the East, a series of exchanges took
place. In the month of November, To&rsquo;uluwa went with his canoe on
a small expedition across the sea to Kitava, and brought back a good
haul of <i lang="kij">mwali</i> (armshells). He arrived on an evening
on the beach of Kaulukuba, and word was sent over to the village that
next day he would come up with his trophies. In the morning, blows of
conch-shell, heard from the distance, announced the approach of the
returning party, and soon, preceded by one of his small sons carrying
the conch-shell, To&rsquo;uluwa made his appearance followed by his
companions. Each man carried a few pairs which he had obtained, whilst
the chief&rsquo;s share was brought in on a stick, hanging down in a
chaplet (see <a href="#pl60">Plate LX</a>).</p>
<p>The people in the village sat before their huts, and according to
native custom, there was no special concourse to meet the chief, nor
any outward signs of excitement. The chief went straight to one of his
<i lang="kij">bulaviyaka</i>, that is, one of his wives&rsquo; houses,
and sat on the platform before it, waiting for some food to come. That
would be the place where he would seat himself, if he wanted just to
have a domestic chat with some of his wives and children. Had any
strangers been there, he would have received them at his place of
official reception, in front of his <i lang="kij">lisiga</i>, the
extremely large and high chief&rsquo;s house, standing in the inner row
of yam houses, and facing the main place, the <i lang="kij">baku</i>
(see <a href="#pl02">Plate II</a>). On that occasion he went to the hut
of Kadamwasila, his favourite wife, the mother of four sons and one
daughter. She is quite old now, but she was the first wife married by
To&rsquo;uluwa himself, that is, not inherited, and there is an
unmistakable attachment and affection between the two, even now. Though
the chief has several much younger and one or two really fine looking
wives, he is usually to be found talking and taking his food with
Kadamwasila. He has also a few older wives, whom, according to the
custom, he inherited <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb472" href="#pb472"
name="pb472">472</a>]</span>from his predecessor, in that case, his
elder brother. The eldest of them, Bokuyoba, the Dean of the Body of
the chief&rsquo;s wives, has been twice inherited; she is now a source
of income&mdash;for her male kinsmen have to supply yams to the
chief&mdash;and an object of veneration, and is now even relieved of
the duty of cooking the chief&rsquo;s food.</p>
<p>To&rsquo;uluwa sat, ate, and talked about his journey to myself and
some of the village elders assembled there. He spoke of the amount of
<i lang="kij">mwali</i> at present in Kitava, told us from whom and how
he obtained those at which we were then looking, naming the most
important ones, and giving bits of their histories. He commented on the
state of gardens in Kitava, which in one respect, in the production of
the big yams (<i lang="kij">kuvi</i>) are the admiration of all the
surrounding districts. He spoke also about future Kula arrangements,
expeditions to arrive from the East in Kiriwina, and of his own planned
movements.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the same day, people from other villages began
to assemble, partly to hear the news of the chief&rsquo;s expedition,
partly in order to find out what they could obtain themselves from him.
Headmen from all the dependent villages sat in one group round the
chief, who now had moved to the official reception ground, in front of
his <i lang="kij">lisiga</i>. Their followers, in company with the
chief&rsquo;s henchmen, and other inhabitants of Omarakana, squatted
all over the <i lang="kij">baku</i> (central place), engaged in
conversation. The talk in each group was of the same subjects, and did
not differ much from the conversation, I had heard from the chief on
his arrival. The newly acquired armshells were handed round, admired,
named, and the manner of their acquisition described.</p>
<p>Next day, several <i lang="kij">soulava</i> (spondylus shell
necklaces) were brought to Omarakana by the various men from
neighbouring villages to the West, and ceremonially offered to
To&rsquo;uluwa (see Plates <a href="#pl61">LXI</a>, <a href=
"#pl62">LXII</a>, and <a href="#pl00">Frontispiece</a>). This was, in
each case a <i lang="kij">vaga</i> (opening gift), for which the giver
expected to receive his <i lang="kij">yotile</i> (clinching gift) at
once from the store of <i lang="kij">mwali</i>. In this case we see the
influence of chieftainship in the relation between Kula partners. In
the inland Kula of Kiriwina, all gifts would be brought to
To&rsquo;uluwa, and he would never have to fetch or carry his presents.
Moreover, he would always be given and never give the opening gift
(<i lang="kij">vaga</i>); while his gift <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb473" href="#pb473" name="pb473">473</a>]</span>would invariably be a
<i lang="kij">yotile</i>. So that the chief sometimes owes a Kula gift
to a commoner, but a commoner never owes a gift to a chief. The
difference between the rules of procedure here and those of an <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> overseas expedition is clear: in a competitive
overseas expedition, valuables for exchange are never carried by the
visiting party, who only receive gifts and bring them back home; in the
inland Kula, the determining factor is the relative social position of
the two partners. Gifts are brought to the man of superior by the man
of inferior rank, and the latter has also to initiate the exchange.</p>
<p>The following entry is quoted literally from my notes, made in
Omarakana, on November the 13th, 1915. &ldquo;This morning, the headman
of Wagaluma brought a <i lang="kij">bagido&rsquo;u</i> (fine necklace).
At the entrance to the village (it is Omarakana), they (the party)
halted, blew the conch shell, put themselves in order. Then, the conch
shell blower went ahead, the men of highest rank took the stick with
the <i lang="kij">bagido&rsquo;u</i>, a boy carrying the heavy wooden
bell pendant on a <i lang="kij">kaboma</i> (wooden dish).&rdquo; This
requires a commentary. The ceremonial way of carrying the spondylus
shell necklaces is by attaching each end to a stick, so that the
necklace hangs down with the pendant at its lowest point (see <a href=
"#pl00">Frontispiece</a> and <a href="#pl61">Pl. LXI</a> and <a href=
"#pl62">LXII</a>). In the case of very long and fine necklaces, in
which the pendant is accordingly big and heavy, while the actual
necklace is thin and fragile, the pendant has to be taken off and
carried apart. Resuming the narrative:&mdash;&ldquo;The headman
approached To&rsquo;uluwa and said: &lsquo;<i lang="kij">Agukuleya,
ikanawo; lagayla lamaye; yoku kayne gala mwali</i>.&rsquo; This he said
in thrusting the stick into the thatch of the chief&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo; The words literally mean: &lsquo;My <i lang=
"kij">kuleya</i> (food left over), take it; I brought it to-day; have
you perhaps no armshells?&rsquo; The expression &lsquo;food left
over,&rsquo; applied to the gift was a depreciating term, meaning
something which is an overflow or unwanted scrap. Thus he was
ironically depreciating his gift, and at the same time implying that
much wealth still remained in his possession. By this, in an oblique
manner, he bragged about his own riches, and with the last phrase,
expressing doubt as to whether To&rsquo;uluwa had any armshells, he
threw a taunt at the chief. This time the gift was returned immediately
by a fine pair of armshells.</p>
<p>It was in connection with the same expedition that the little
exchange between two of the chief&rsquo;s wives took place,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb474" href="#pb474" name=
"pb474">474</a>]</span>mentioned before (in <a href="#div11.2">Chapter
XI, Division II</a>, under 4) and one or two more domestic Kula acts
were performed, a son of To&rsquo;uluwa offering him a necklace (see
<a href="#pl61">Plates LXI</a> and <a href="#pl62">LXII</a>) and
receiving a pair of armshells afterwards. Many more transactions took
place in those two days or so; sounds of conch shells were heard on all
sides as they were blown first in the village from which the men
started, then on the way, then at the entrance to Omarakana, and
finally at the moment of giving. Again, after some time another blast
announced the return gift by To&rsquo;uluwa, and the receding sounds of
the conch marked the stages of the going home of the party.
To&rsquo;uluwa himself never receives a gift with his own hands; it is
always hung up in his house or platform, and then somebody of his
household takes charge of it; but the commoner receives the armshell
himself from the hands of the chief. There was much life and movement
in the village during this time of concentrated exchange; parties came
and went with <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, others arrived as mere
spectators, and the place was always full of a gazing crowd. The soft
sounds of the conch shell, so characteristic of all South Sea
experiences, gave a special flavour to the festive and ceremonial
atmosphere of those days.</p>
<p>Not all the armshells brought from Kitava were thus at once given
away. Some of them were kept for the purposes of more distant Kula; or
to be given on some future, special occasion when a present had to be
handed over in association with some ceremony. In the inland Kula,
there is always an outbreak of transactions whenever a big quantity of
valuables is imported into the district. And afterwards, sporadic
transactions happen now and then. For the minor partners who had
received armshells from To&rsquo;uluwa would not all of them keep them
for any length of time, but part of them would be sooner or later
passed on in inland transactions. But, however these valuables might
spread over the district, they would be always available when an
expedition from another Kula community would come and claim them. When
the party from Sinaketa came in March, 1918, to Omarakana, all those
who owned armshells would either come to the capital or else be visited
in their villages by their Sinaketan partners. Of the 154 or so
armshells obtained in Kiriwina on that occasion, only thirty came from
To&rsquo;uluwa himself, and fifty from Omarakana <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb475" href="#pb475" name=
"pb475">475</a>]</span>altogether, while the rest were given from other
villages, in the following proportions:</p>

<p class="first">It will be necessary to give a more detailed account
of the actual conditions obtaining in Boyowa <span class="corr" id=

the various Kula communities in that district. Looking at <a href=
"#map4">Map IV</a>, p. 50, we see there the boundaries of Kiriwina,
which is the easternmost Kula community in the Northern part of the
islands. To the west of it the provinces of Tilataula, Kuboma, and
Kulumata form another Kula community, or, it would be more correct to
say, some of the men in these districts make the inland Kula with
members of neighbouring communities. But these three provinces do not
form as a whole a Kula community. In the first place, many villages are
quite outside the Kula, that is, not even their headmen belong to the
inter-tribal exchange. Remarkably enough, all the big industrial
centres, such as Bwoytalu, Luya, Yalaka, Kadukwaykela, Buduwaylaka, do
not take part in the Kula. An interesting myth localised in Yalaka
tells how the inhabitants of that village, prevented by custom from
seeing the world on Kula expeditions, attempted to erect a high pillar
reaching to heaven, so as to find a field for their adventures in the
skies. Unfortunately, it fell down, and only one man remained above,
who is now responsible for thunder and lightning. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb476" href="#pb476" name="pb476">476</a>]</span></p>
<p>Another important omission in the Kula is that of the Northern
villages of Laba&rsquo;i, Kaybola, Lu&rsquo;ebila, Idaleaka, Kapwani
and Yuwada. If we remember that Laba&rsquo;i is the very centre of
Kiriwinian mythology, that there lies the very hole out of which the
original ancestors of the four clans emerged from underground, that the
highest chiefs of Kiriwina trace their descent from Laba&rsquo;i, this
omission appears all the more remarkable and mysterious.</p>
<p>Thus the whole Western half of the Northern Trobriands forms a unit
of sorts in the chain of Kula communities, but it cannot be considered
as a fully fledged one, for only sporadic individuals belong to it, and
again, that district as a whole, or even individual canoes from it,
never take part in any overseas Kula expedition. The village of
Kavataria makes big overseas sailings to the Western
d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux Islands. Though these expeditions really have
nothing to do with the Kula we shall say a few words about this in the
next chapter but one.</p>
<p>Passing now to the West, we find the island of Kayleula, which,
together with two or three smaller islands, to its South, Kuyawa,
Manuwata, and Nubiyam, form a &lsquo;Kula <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e20459" title="Source: comunity">community</span>&rsquo; of its
own. This community is again slightly anomalous, for they make Kula
only on a small scale, on the one hand with the chiefs and headmen of
Kiriwina, and of the North-Western district of Boyowa, and on the other
hand with the Amphletts, but never with Dobu. They also used to make
long and perilous trips to the Western d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux, sailing
further West and for longer distances than the natives of
Kavataria.</p>
<p>The main Kula communities in the South of Boyowa, Sinaketa and
Vakuta, have been described already, and sufficiently defined in the
previous chapters. Sinaketa is the centre for inland Kula of the South,
which, though on a smaller scale than the inland Kula of the North,
still unites half-a-dozen villages round Sinaketa. That village also
carries on Kula with three coastal villages in the East, Okayaulo,
Bwaga, and Kumilabwaga, who link it up with Kitava, to where they make
journeys from time to time. These villages form again the sort of
imperfect &lsquo;Kula community,&rsquo; or perhaps one on a very small
scale, for they would never have an <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> of their
own, and the amount of transactions which pass through them is very
small. Another such small community, independent as regards
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb477" href="#pb477" name=
"pb477">477</a>]</span>Kula, is the village of Wawela. The district of
Luba, which sometimes joins with Kiriwina in carrying on a big
expedition, also sometimes joins with Wawela on small expeditions. Such
nondescript or intermediate phenomena of transition are always to be
found in studying the life of native races, where most social rules
have not got the same precision as with us. There is among them neither
any strong, psychological tendency to consistent thinking, nor are the
local peculiarities and exceptions rubbed off by the influence of
example or competition.</p>
<p>I cannot say very much about the inland Kula in other regions
besides the Trobriands. I have seen it done in Woodlark Island, at the
very beginning of my work among the Northern Massim, and that was the
first time that I came across any of the symptoms of the Kula. Early in
1915, in the village of Dikoyas, I heard conch shells blown, there was
a general commotion in the village, and I saw the presentation of a
large <i lang="kij">bagido&rsquo;u</i>. I, of course, inquired about
the meaning of the custom, and was told that this is one of the
exchanges of presents made when visiting friends. At that time I had no
inkling that I had been a witness of a detailed manifestation, of what
I subsequently found out was Kula. On the whole, however, I have been
told by natives from Kitava and Gawa, later on whilst working in the
Trobriands, that the customs of Kula exchange there are identical with
those obtaining in Kiriwina. And the same I was told is the case in
Dobu. It must be realised, however, that the inland Kula must be
somewhat different in a community where, as in Kitava, for instance,
the strands of the Kula all come together in a small space, and the
stream of valuables, which has been flowing through the broad area of
the Trobriands, there concentrates into three small villages. If we
estimate the inhabitants of the Trobriands with Vakuta at up to ten
thousand, while those of Kitava at no more than five hundred, there
will be about twenty times as many valuables per head of inhabitants in
Kitava as compared to the Trobriands.</p>
<p>Another such place of concentration is the island of Tubetube, and I
think one or two places in Woodlark Island, where the village of
Yanabwa is said to be an independent link in the chain, through which
every article has to pass. But this brings us already to the Eastern
Kula, which will form the subject of the next chapter. <span class=

example of this ill-judged attitude of interference is to be found even
in a book written by an exceptionally <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e20131" title="Source: well informed">well-informed</span> and
enlightened missionary, &ldquo;In Far New Guinea,&rdquo; by Henry
Newton. In describing the feasts and dancing of the natives, he admits
these to be a necessity of tribal life: &ldquo;On the whole the
feasting and dancing are good; they give excitement and relaxation to
the young men, and tone the drab colours of life.&rdquo; He himself
tells us that, &ldquo;the time comes when the old men stop the dancing.
They begin to growl because the gardens are neglected, and they want to
know if dancing will give the people food, so the order is given that
the drums are to be hung up, and the people settle down to work.&rdquo;
But in spite of Mr. Newton&rsquo;s recognition of this natural, tribal
authority, in spite of the fact that he really admits the views given
in our <span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e20134" href="#xd26e20134"
name="xd26e20134">467n</a>]</span> text, he cannot refrain from saying:
&ldquo;Seriously, however, for the benefit of the people themselves, it
would be a good thing if there could be some regulations&mdash;if
dancing were not allowed after midnight, for while it lasts nothing
else is done.&mdash;The gardens suffer and it would help the people to
learn self-restraint and so strengthen their characters if the dancing
could be regulated.&rdquo; He goes on to admit quite candidly that it
would be difficult to enforce such a regulation because &ldquo;to the
native mind, it would seem that it was the comfort of the white man,
not the benefit of the native which was the reason for the
regulation.&rdquo; And to my mind also, I am afraid!</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The following quotations from a recent
scientific work published by the Oxford Press&mdash;&ldquo;The Northern
d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux,&rdquo; by D. Jenness, and the Rev. A.
Ballantyne, 1920&mdash;are also examples of the dangerous and heedless
tampering with the one authority that now binds the natives, the one
discipline they can be relied upon to observe&mdash;that of their own
tribal tradition. The relations of a church member who died, were
&ldquo;counselled to drop the harsher elements in their
mourning,&rdquo; and instead of the people being bidden &ldquo;to
observe each jot and tittle of their old, time-honoured rites,&rdquo;
they were advised from that day forth to leave off &ldquo;those which
had no meaning.&rdquo; It is strange to find a trained ethnologist,
confessing that old, time-honoured rites have no meaning! And one might
feel tempted to ask: for <i>whom</i> it is that these customs have no
meaning, for the natives or for the writers of the passage quoted?</p>
<p class="footnote cont">The following incident is even more telling. A
native headman of an inland village was supposed to keep concealed in
his hut a magic pot, the &ldquo;greatest ruler of winds, rain, and
sunshine,&rdquo; a pot which had &ldquo;come down from times
immemorial,&rdquo; which according to some of the natives &ldquo;in the
beginning simply was.&rdquo; According to the Authors, the owner of the
pot used to descend on the coastal natives and &ldquo;levy
tribute,&rdquo; threatening them with the magical powers of the pot if
they refused. Some of the coastal natives went to the Missionary and
asked him to interfere or get the magistrate to do so. It was arranged
they should all go with the Missionary and seize the pot. But on the
day &ldquo;only one man turned up.&rdquo; When the Missionary went,
however, the natives blocked his path, and only through threats of
punishments by the magistrate, were they induced to temporarily leave
the village and thus to allow him to seize the pot! A few days later
the Missionary accordingly took possession of the pot, which he broke.
The Authors go on to say that after this incident &ldquo;everyone was
contented and happy;&rdquo; except, one might add, the natives and
those who would see in such occurrences the speedy destruction of
native culture, and the final disintegration of the
race.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e20128src">&uarr;</a></p>

<p class="first">The subject of which this book treats and the material
at our disposal are nearly exhausted. In describing the Southern branch
of the Kula (between Sinaketa and Dobu) I entered into the details of
its rules and associated aspects, and almost all that was said there
refers to the Kula as a whole. In speaking of the N.E. branch of the
Kula, which I am now about to describe, there will not therefore be
very much new to tell. All the general rules of exchange and types of
behaviour are the same as those previously defined. Here we have also
big <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> expeditions and small, non-ceremonial
sailings. The type of partnership between Kiriwinians and Kitavans is
the same here, as the one obtaining within the Trobriands, and
described in the last chapter. For the natives of the Eastern islands,
from Kitava to Woodlark, have the same social organisation and the same
culture as the Trobrianders, and speak the same language with
dialectical differences only. Never any but friendly relations have
obtained between them and many people are united by bonds of real
kinship across the seas, for there have been migrations between the
districts, and marriages are also not infrequent. Thus the general
relations between overseas partners are different here from those
between Sinaketa and Dobu. The visiting is not associated with any deep
apprehensions, there is no <i lang="kij">ka&rsquo;ubana&rsquo;i</i>
(danger magic), and the relations between the visitors and hosts are
much more free and easy and intimate. The rest of the Kula magic
(except the <i lang="kij">ka&rsquo;ubana&rsquo;i</i>) is identical With
that in the South, and indeed much of it, as used all over Boyowa, has
been received from the Kitavans. Many of the preliminary customs and
arrangements of the Kula, the preparation of the canoes, ceremonial
launching and <i lang="kij">kabigidoya</i> are the same here. In fact,
the launching <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb479" href="#pb479" name=
"pb479">479</a>]</span>described in <a href="#ch6">Chapter VI</a> was
the one I saw on the beach of Omarakana.</p>
<p>On the actual expeditions, much of the ceremonial and all the rules
of the Kula gifts, as well as of the <i lang="kij">pari</i> and
<i lang="kij">talo&rsquo;i</i>, the initial and farewell presents, are
the same as in the South-Western branch of the Kula. The best plan will
be to tell the story of a typical <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> expedition
from Kiriwina to Kitava, noting the similarities and emphasising the
differences, while one or two points of divergence will claim our
special attention. There is a small, but interesting incident called
<i lang="kij">youlawada</i>, a custom which allows a visiting party to
attack and damage the house ornaments of a man, to whom they bring a
gift. Another important speciality of this Eastern Kula is the
association of a mortuary feast called <i lang="kij">so&rsquo;i</i>
with particularly abundant distributions of <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>.</p>
<p>I had opportunities of collecting notes about the North-Eastern Kula
and of making observations during my residence in Omarakana, in
1915&ndash;1916. I saw several expeditions from Kitava arrive on the
beach, and camp for a few days. To&rsquo;uluwa went twice to Kitava,
and his return from one of these visits has been described in the last
chapter. He also once started for an expedition there, of which I was a
member. There was a change of wind, some time in September, and with
the North wind which we hoped would last for a few hours, it would have
been possible to cross to Kitava and to return at our pleasure with the
prevailing South-Easterly. Half-way to our goal, the wind changed and
we had to return, to my great disappointment, though this gave me a
good example of the entire dependence of the natives on the weather.
Unfortunately, To&rsquo;uluwa got it into his head that I had brought
him bad luck, and so when he planned his next trip, I was not taken
into his confidence or allowed to form one of the party. Two years
later, when I lived in Oburaka, about half-way between the Northern and
Southernmost end of Boyowa, several expeditions from Kitava visited
Wawela, a village lying across on the other side of the island, which
here is no more than a mile and a half wide; and one or two expeditions
left from Wawela for Kitava. The only big expedition which came under
my notice was the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> which was to leave some
time in April or May, 1916, from Kiriwina to the East. I saw only the
preparatory stages, of which the launching was described in <a href=
"#ch6">Chapter VII</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb480" href=
"#pb480" name="pb480">480</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let us imagine that we follow the course of this Kiriwinian <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i>. The first general intimation that it would take
place, came after one of the visits which To&rsquo;ulawa made to
Kitava. He had heard there that a considerable quantity of armshells
was soon to come to the island, for, as we shall see by the end of this
Chapter, such big, concerted movements of valuables along the ring take
place from time to time. To&rsquo;ulawa then and there made
arrangements with his chief partner, Kwaywaya, to make an <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i>, which was to be the means of carrying on the big
movement of the <i lang="kij">mwali</i>. On his return to Omarakana,
when the headmen of the other Kiriwinian villages assembled, the plans
of the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> were talked over and details arranged.
Even in olden days, before the chief&rsquo;s power was undermined,
though he used to take the initiative, and give decisions in important
matters, he had to put the case before the other headmen, and listen to
what they had to say. Their opinions on the occasion of which we are
speaking, would hardly ever be in contradiction to his wishes, and it
was decided without much discussion to make the <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> in about six months&rsquo; time. Soon after, the
rebuilding or refitting of the canoes began, in the manner previously
described. The only slight difference in the preparations between
Kiriwina and Sinaketa lies in the preliminary trade. The Kiriwinians
have to go inland to the industrial districts of Kuboma, and they go
there every man on his own account, to acquire the articles needed.</p>
<p>It will be best to say here at once all that is necessary about the
trade between Kiriwina and Kitava. As these two districts are
geologically and in other respects much more similar to one another
than Sinaketa and Dobu are, the trade is not of such vital importance,
with one notable exception, as we shall see. The articles of subsidiary
trade, which a Kiriwinian expedition would carry with them to Kitava,
are the following:&mdash;wooden combs; various classes of lime pots;
armlets, plaited of fern fibre; turtle-shell earrings; mussel shell;
coils of lashing creeper (<i lang="kij">wayugo</i>); plaited fern
belts, made originally in the d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux. Of these articles,
the most important are probably the mussel shells, used for scraping
and as knives, the various kinds of lime pots, which are a speciality
of Kuboma, and last, but not least, the <i lang="kij">wayugo</i>. I am
not quite certain as to whether this creeper is not to be <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb481" href="#pb481" name=
"pb481">481</a>]</span>found in Kitava, but as it grows only on marshy
soil, it is hardly probable that it would thrive on a high, raised,
coral island. In that case, the creeper is certainly the most
indispensable of all the trade articles imported into Kitava from the
Trobriands.</p>
<p>The Trobrianders import from the smaller islands a class of grass
skirt made of coco-nut leaves; exceptionally well finished urn-shaped
baskets; small hand-baskets; specially bleached pandanus mats;
ornaments made of fragments of conus shell; certain classes of cowrie
shell, used for ornamenting belts; ebony lime spatul&aelig;; ebony
walking staves; sword-clubs carved in ebony; and an aromatic black
paint, made of charred sandal wood. None of these articles is of vital
importance, as all of them, though perhaps in slightly different or
even inferior quality, are manufactured or found in the Trobriands.</p>
<p>There was one article, however, which, in the olden days, was of
surpassing utility to the Trobriand natives, and which they could
obtain only from Kitava, though it came originally from further East,
from Murua (Woodlark Island). These were the <i lang=
"kij">kukumali</i>, or roughly shaped pieces of green-stone, which were
then polished in the Trobriands, and in this state used as stone
implements, while the biggest of them, very large and thin and well
polished all over, became a specially important class of <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> (articles of high value). Although the
practical use of stone implements has naturally been done away with by
the introduction of steel and iron, the <i lang="kij">beku</i>
(valuable axe blades) have still an undiminished, indeed, an increased
value, as the white traders have to use them for purchasing pearls from
the natives. It is important to note that although all the raw material
for these stone implements and valuables had to be imported from
Kitava, the finished valuables were and are re-exported again, as
Kiriwina is still the main polishing district.</p>
<p>As to the manner in which the trade was done between the Kiriwinians
and Kitavans, all that has been said previously on the subject of
inter-tribal trade holds good; part of the goods carried were given as
presents, part of them were exchanged with non-partners, some were
gifts received from the partners on leaving. <span class=

<p class="first">Returning to To&rsquo;ulawa and his companions, as
time went on there was more and more stir in the villages. As usually,
all sorts of ambitious plans were framed, and the youthful members of
the party hoped that they would reach Muyuwa (or Murua, Woodlark
Island) where Kula was not done, but where Kiriwinian parties sometimes
went in order to witness certain festivities. On the subject of Muyuwa,
Bagido&rsquo;u, the elderly heir apparent of Omarakana, who however, as
said in the previous chapter, will never succeed his uncle, had to tell
his own experiences. As a small boy, he sailed there with one of the
big chiefs of Omarakana, his maternal grandfather. They went to Suloga,
the place where the green stone was quarried.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;There,&rdquo; spoke Bagido&rsquo;u,
&ldquo;there was a big <i lang="kij">dubwadebula</i> (grotto or rock
shelf). The members of the Lukulabuta clan (this clan is called
Kulutalu in Muyuwa) of Suloga, were the <i lang="kij">toli</i>
(masters, owners) of this <i lang="kij">dubwadebula</i>, and could
quarry the stone. They knew some <i lang="kij">megwa</i> (magic); they
charmed their <span class="corr" id="xd26e20601" title=
"Source: axeblades">axe-blades</span>, and hit the walls of the
<i lang="kij">dubwadebula</i>. The <i lang="kij">kukumali</i> (pieces
of stone) fell down. When the men of Boyowa came to Suloga, they gave
<i lang="kij">pari</i> (presents) to the Lukulabuta men of Suloga. They
gave them <i lang="kij">paya</i> (turtle shell), <i lang=
"kij">kwasi</i> (armlets), <i lang="kij">sinata</i> (combs). Then, the
Suloga men would show us the <i lang="kij">kukumali</i>, and tell us:
&lsquo;Take them with you, take plenty.&rsquo; Good <i lang=
"kij">kukumali</i>, which could be made into a <i lang="kij">beku</i>
(big wealth-blades) we would pay for; we would give our <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> (valuables) in exchange. At parting, they would
give us more <i lang="kij">kukumali</i> as <i lang=
"kij">talo&rsquo;i</i> (farewell gift).&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It must be remembered, in comment on this narrative, that when
Bagido&rsquo;u went to Suloga, some thirty or forty years ago, the iron
and steel had already long before rendered the small <i lang=
"kij">kukumali</i> quite useless and worthless to the natives, while
the big <i lang="kij">kukumali</i> had still their full value, as
material for the large blades which serve as tokens of wealth. Hence,
the big ones had still to be paid for, and hence also the generous
invitation to take as many of the small ones, as they liked, an
invitation of which the visitors, with corresponding delicacy, refused
to avail themselves.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20651src" href=
"#xd26e20651" name="xd26e20651src">1</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Another hero of the occasion was old Ibena, one of the Tabalu
(members of the highest rank) of Kasana&rsquo;i, the sister village of
Omarakana. He has spent a long time on the island of Iwa, and knew the
myths and magic of the Eastern archipelago very well. He would sit down
and tell for hours various stories of famous Kula expeditions, of
mythological incidents, and of the peculiar customs of the Eastern
islands. It was from him that I first obtained my information about the
<i lang="kij">mulukwausi</i> and their customs, about shipwreck and the
means of saving the party, about the love magic of Iwa, and many other
facts, which only a man of cosmopolitan experience and culture, like
Ibena, would know and understand thoroughly. He was a good informant,
eager to instruct and to display his wisdom and knowledge, and not
devoid of imagination; of the licentious and libidinous women of
Kaytalugi (see <a href="#ch10">Chapter X</a>) and of what a man has to
suffer there, he would speak as if he had been there himself. At this
time, he was specially loquacious about the Kula, and associated
customs, inspired as he was by the hope of re-visiting his old haunts,
and by the admiration and reverence shown to him by his listeners,
myself included.</p>
<p>The other members of the audience were most interested in his
accounts of how they make gardens in Kitava, Iwa and Gawa; of the
special dances performed there, of the technicalities of Kula, and of
the great efficiency of the Iwan love magic.</p>
<p>At that time, I was able to obtain more information about the Kula,
and that more easily and in a shorter while, than I had, with strenuous
efforts, for months before. It is by taking advantage of such epochs,
when the interest of the natives is centred round a certain subject,
that ethnographic evidence can be collected in the easiest and most
reliable manner. Natives will willingly state customs and rules, and
they will also accurately and with interest follow up concrete cases.
Here, for instance, they would trace the way in which a given pair of
armshells had passed through the hands of several individuals, and was
now supposed to have come round again to Kitava&mdash;and in such a way
one receives from the natives definite ethnographic documents,
realities of thought, and details of belief, instead of forced
artificial verbiage. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb484" href="#pb484"
name="pb484">484</a>]</span></p>
<p>I saw the proceedings as far as the ceremonial launching of the
chiefs&rsquo; canoes in Kasana&rsquo;i and Omarakana (cf. <a href=
"#ch6">Chapter VI</a>), when the natives assembled in big numbers, and
various festivities took place. Afterwards when everything was ready
for sailing, a similar crowd gathered on the beach, though less
numerous than the previous one, for only the neighbouring villages were
there instead of the whole district. The chief addressed the crowd,
enjoining strict taboos on strangers entering the village while the men
were away. Such taboos, on the surface at least, are very carefully
kept, as I had opportunities to observe during the two previous
absences of To&rsquo;uluwa. Early in the evening, everybody retired
into his or her house, the outside fires were extinguished and when I
walked through the village, it was quite deserted and except for a few
old men specially keeping watch, no one was to be seen. Strangers would
be careful not to pass even through the outskirts of the village after
sunset, and would take another road to avoid the grove of
Omarakana.</p>
<p>Even men from the sister-village of Kasana&rsquo;i were excluded
from entering the capital, and on one occasion when two or three of
them wanted to visit their friends, they were stopped from doing it by
some of the old men, with a considerable display of indignation and
authority. As it happened, a day or two afterwards, but still while the
Kula party were away, one of the favourite sons of To&rsquo;uluwa,
called Nabwasu&rsquo;a<span class="corr" id="xd26e20678" title=
"Not in source">,</span> who had not gone on the expedition, was caught
<i lang="la">in flagrante delicto</i> of adultery with the youngest
wife of the very old chief of Kasana&rsquo;i. The people of the latter
village were highly incensed, not without an admixture of malicious
amusement. One of these who had been expelled two nights before from
Omarakana took a conch shell and with its blast announced to the wide
world the shame and scandal of Omarakana. As a conch shell is blown
only on very important and ceremonial occasion, this was a slap in the
face of the supposedly virtuous community, and a reproach of its
hypocrisy. A man of Kasana&rsquo;i, speaking in a loud <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e20684" title="Source: vocie">voice</span>, addressed
the people of Omarakana:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t allow us to enter your village;
you call us adulterous (<i lang="kij">tokaylasi</i>); but we wanted
only to go and visit our friends. And look here, Nabwasu&rsquo;a
committed adultery in our village!&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb485" href="#pb485" name=

<p>The <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> party, to whom we now return, would
cross the sea in a few hours and arrive in Kitava. Their manner of
sailing, the arrangement of men in the canoe, the taboos of sailing are
the same as in Sinaketa. My knowledge of their canoe magic is much
smaller than of that in Southern Boyowa, but I think they have got far
fewer rites. The sailing on these seas is on the whole easier, for
there are fewer reefs, and the two prevailing winds would either bring
them towards the Eastern islands, or push them back towards the long
coast of Boyowa. The natives of Kiriwina are on the other hand far less
expert sailors than the Sinaketans.</p>
<p>They have the same beliefs about the dangers at sea, especially
about the participation of the flying witches in shipwreck. The history
of such a calamity and the means of escape from it, given in one of the
foregoing chapters (<a href="#ch10">Chapter X</a>), refers to these
seas, as well as to the sea-arm of Pilolu.</p>
<p>These natives, as well as the Southern Boyowans, feel and appreciate
the romance of sailing; they are visibly excited at the idea of an
expedition, they enjoy even the sight of the open sea on the Eastern
coast beyond the <i lang="kij">raybwag</i> (coral ridge), and often
walk there on mere pleasure parties. The Eastern coast is much finer
than the beach of the Lagoon; steep, dark rocks alternate there with
fine, sandy beaches, the tall jungle spreading over the higher and
lower parts of the shore. The sailing to Kitava does not present,
however, the same contrasts as an expedition to the
d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux Islands from Southern Boyowa. The natives remain
still in the world of raised coral islands, which they know from their
own home. Even the island of Muyuwa (or Murua, Woodlark Island) where I
spent a short time, does not present such a definite contrast in
landscape as that between the Trobriands and the Koya. I do not know
from personal experience the Marshall Bennett Islands, but from an
excellent description given by Professor Seligman, they seem to be good
specimens of small raised atolls.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20713src"
href="#xd26e20713" name="xd26e20713src">2</a></p>
<p>With regard to magic, the most important initial rites over the
<i lang="kij">lilava</i> and <i lang="kij">sulumwoya</i> are done in
the village by the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> (compare above, <a href=
"#ch7">Chapter VII</a>). The magic over the four coco-nuts in the canoe
is not performed in Kiriwina. On arrival at the beach in Kitava, all
the rites of beauty magic, as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb486"
href="#pb486" name="pb486">486</a>]</span>well as the magic over the
conch shell are recited in a manner identical to that in Sarubwoyna
(<a href="#ch13">Chapter XIII</a>). Here, however, the natives have to
make the last stage of the journey on foot.</p>
<p>The party, headed by a small boy, probably a youngest son of the
<i lang="kij">toliwaga</i>, after whom the chief and the others follow,
would march towards the village which is situated beyond the elevated
ridge. When <i lang="kij">soulava</i> (necklaces) are brought by the
party&mdash;which, it must be remembered is never the case on an
<i lang="kij">uvalaku</i>&mdash;they would be carried ceremonially on
sticks by some men following the chief. In that case, that is when the
party are bringing Kula gifts&mdash;the <i lang="kij">youlawada</i>
ceremony is performed. On entering the village, the party march on
briskly without looking to right or left, and, whilst the boy blows
frantically the conch shell, and all the men in the party emit the
intermittent ceremonial scream called <i lang="kij">tilaykiki</i>,
others throw stones and spears at the <i lang="kij">kavalapu</i>, the
ornamental carved and painted boards running in a Gothic arch round the
eaves of a chief&rsquo;s house or yam house. Almost all the <i lang=
"kij">kavalapu</i> in the Eastern villages are slightly injured, that
of To&rsquo;uluwa having one of its ends knocked off. The damage is not
repaired, as it is a mark of distinction.</p>

Feast.</p>
<p>This picture was taken on the South coast of New Guinea. (cf. Div.
II of this Ch. and Div. III of Ch. II.)</p>
</div>
<p>This custom is not known in the Kula between Sinaketa and Dobu or
Sinaketa and Kiriwina. It begins on the Eastern shore of the
Trobriands, and is carried on as far as Tubetube where it stops again,
for it is not practised in Wari (Teste Island) or on the portion of the
Kula between Tubetube and Dobu. I myself never saw it practised in the
Trobriands, but I saw a similar custom among the Massim of the South
Coast of New Guinea. At a <i lang="kij">so&rsquo;i</i> feast which I
witnessed in three different villages as it progressed from one to the
other, the party who brought in gifts of pigs to a man attempted to do
some damage to his trees or his house. A pig is always slung by its
legs on a long, stout pole, dangling head downwards (see <a href=
"#pl05">Plates V</a> and <a href="#pl63">LXIII</a>): with this pole the
natives would ram a young coco-nut or betel-nut palm or a fruit tree
and if not stopped by the owners would break or uproot it, the pig
squealing and the women of the damaged party screaming in unison.
Again, a party entering a village with gifts to one of the inhabitants,
would throw miniature spears at his house. A distinct show of
fierceness and hostility is displayed on both sides by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb487" href="#pb487" name=
"pb487">487</a>]</span>natives on such occasions. Although the somewhat
histrionic attack, and the slight but real damage to property were
sanctioned by tribal usage, not infrequently among the Southern Massim
serious quarrels and scrimmages were started by it. This custom has
been observed by Professor Seligman among the natives of Bartle Bay.
&ldquo;As a man passed the house, they speared the wall with the
branches they had been waving, and left them stuck in the walls.&rdquo;
And again: &ldquo;&hellip; the people bringing them (the pigs) in,
carried branches of trees or pieces of stick with a wisp of grass tied
to the end, and with these speared the house of the man to whom the
pigs were given.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20786src" href=
"#xd26e20786" name="xd26e20786src">3</a></p>
<p>When we remember what has been said about the style in which all
gifts are given; that is, so to speak, thrown down fiercely and almost
contemptuously by the giver; when we remember the taunts with which
gifts are often accompanied, as well as the manner in which they are
received, the <i lang="kij">youlawada</i> custom appears only as an
exaggerated form of this manner of giving, fixed into a definite
ceremonial. It is interesting from this point of view to note that the
<i lang="kij">youlawada</i> is only done in association with <i lang=
"kij">vaga</i> (initial gifts) and not with the <i lang=
"kij">yotile</i> (return gifts).</p>
<p>The Kiriwinian party, after having paid their preliminary ceremonial
visit in the village, given their gifts, both of the Kula and of the
<i lang="kij">pari</i> type, and had a long chat with their partners
and friends, return in the evening to the beach, where they camp near
their canoes. Sometimes temporary huts are erected, sometimes in fine
weather the natives sleep under mats on the sand beach. Food is brought
to them from the village by young, unmarried girls, who very often on
that occasion arrange their intrigues with the visitors. The party will
remain for a few days paying calls to the other villages of the island,
talking, inspecting the gardens and hoping for more Kula presents. The
food of Kitava is not tabooed to the chiefs, as the Kitavans abstain
from the worst abominations. At parting the visitors receive their
<i lang="kij">talo&rsquo;i</i> gifts which are brought down to their
canoes.</p>
<p>The visits are returned by the Kitavans in very much the same
manner. They camp on the sand beaches of the Eastern Coast. When
weather-bound they erect temporary habitations, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb488" href="#pb488" name="pb488">488</a>]</span>and
I have seen whole families, men, women, and children living for days on
some of the Eastern shores. For it is the custom of the men of Kitava
to carry their women and small children on their trips. The Kiriwinians
take sometimes unmarried girls, but they would never take their wives
and small children, whilst in the South no Sinaketan women at all go on
a Kula voyage however small and unimportant a one it may be. From big
<i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> expeditions, women are excluded in all the
districts.</p>
<p>It has been mentioned in the last chapter that Kitava enjoys a
privileged position in the Ring, for every single piece of valuables
has to pass through it. The island of Kitava is a &lsquo;Kula
community&rsquo; in itself. All its neighbours to the West, the Kula
communities of Kiriwina, Luba, Wawela, Southern Boyowa (that is, the
villages of Okayyaulo, Bwaga and Kumilabwaga) cannot skip Kitava when
they are exchanging, and the same refers to the Kitavan neighbours in
the East. In other words, a man from the Eastern islands beyond Kitava,
if he wants to pass an armshell westwards, has to give it to a Kitava
man, and may not give it directly to some one beyond. The islands East
of Kitava, Iwa, Gawa, and Kwayawata form one community. This is shown
on <a href="#map5">Map V</a>, where each &lsquo;Kula community&rsquo;
is represented by one circle. The Kula stream, after having
concentrated in Kitava, spreads out again, but by no means as broadly
as when it runs to the Westward, and overflows over the broad area of
the Trobriands. Another point, in which the Kula of Kitava differs from
that of Sinaketa or Kiriwina, a point on which I have touched already
once before (in <a href="#div13.1">Chapter XIII, Division I</a>) is
that the small island has to make overseas exchanges on both sides. As
we saw, the Sinaketans carry on big expeditions and make <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> only to their Southern partners, so that they receive
only the one Kula article, the necklaces in this manner, while their
armshells come to them by inland Kula, from their Northern and Eastern
neighbours. The same <i lang="la">mutatis mutandis</i> refers to the
Kiriwinians, who receive all their necklaces overland and make overseas
Kula for their armshells only. The two islands of Kitava and Vakuta, as
well as the other Marshall Bennetts are, so to speak, ambidextrous in
the Kula and have to fetch and carry both articles overseas. This, of
course, results primarily from the geographical position in a district
and a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb489" href="#pb489" name=
"pb489">489</a>]</span>glance at <a href="#map5">Map V</a> will easily
show which Kula communities have to carry all their transactions
overseas and which of them have to do one half of them overland. These
latter are only the Trobriand districts mentioned in the previous
Chapter and the districts in Dobu.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">III</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">This exhausts all the peculiarities of the Kula in
Kitava except one, and that a very important one. It has been mentioned
before, in fact it is obvious from the account of the <i lang=
"kij">uvalaku</i> custom that the Kula does not run with an even flow,
but in violent gushes. Thus the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> expedition
from Dobu described in <a href="#ch16">Chapter XVI</a> carried about
800 pairs of armshells from Boyowa. Such sudden rushes of the Kula
articles are associated with an important institution, which is not
known in the Trobriands or in Dobu, but which we find in Kitava and
further along the Ring, as far as Tubetube (see <a href="#map5">Map
V</a>). When a man dies, custom imposes a taboo upon the inhabitants of
that village. This means that no one on a visit is received in the
village, and no Kula articles are given away from there. The community
lying under the taboo, however, expect to receive as many Kula gifts as
possible, and busy themselves in that matter. After a certain time, a
big ceremony and distribution of goods, called <i lang=
"kij">so&rsquo;i</i> is held, and invitations are sent out to all the
Kula partners, and, in the case of a big affair, even to people from
districts beyond the boundary of partnership. A big distribution of
food takes place in which all the guests receive their share, and then
the Kula valuables are given in great quantities to the partners of
that community.</p>
<p>The association of taboo on economic goods with mourning is a
wide-spread feature of the Melanesian customs in New Guinea. I found it
among the Mailu on the South Coast of New Guinea, where a taboo, called
<i lang="kij">gora</i>, is put on coco-nuts as one of the features of
mourning.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20863src" href="#xd26e20863" name=
"xd26e20863src">4</a> The same institution, as we saw, obtains in Dobu.
Similar taboos are to be found among the Southern Massim.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e20866src" href="#xd26e20866" name=
"xd26e20866src">5</a></p>
<p>The importance of such economic taboos at times of mourning is due
to another wide-spread association, that <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb490" href="#pb490" name="pb490">490</a>]</span>namely which obtains
between mourning and feasts, or, more correctly, distributions of food,
which are made at intervals during a more or less prolonged period
after a person&rsquo;s death. An especially big feast, or rather
distribution, is made at the end of the period, and on this occasion
the accumulated goods, usually coco-nut, betel-nut and pigs, are
distributed. Death among all the coastal natives of Eastern New Guinea
causes a great and permanent disturbance in the equilibrium of tribal
life. On the one hand, there is the stemming of the normal flow of
economic consumption. On the other hand, an innumerable series of
rites, ceremonies and festive distributions, which one and all create
all sorts of reciprocal obligations, take up the best part of the
energy, attention and time of the natives for a period of a few months,
or a couple of years according to the importance of the dead. The
immense social and economic upheaval which occurs after each death is
one of the most salient features of the culture of these natives, and
one also which on its surface strikes us as enigmatic and which entices
into all sorts of speculations and reflections. What makes the problem
still more obscure and complex is the fact that all these taboos,
feasts, and rites have nothing whatever to do, in the belief of the
natives, with the spirit of the deceased. This latter has gone at once
and settled definitely in another world, entirely oblivious of what
happens in the villages and especially of what is done in memory of his
former existence.</p>
<p>The <i lang="kij">so&rsquo;i</i> (distribution of food) as found in
Kitava is the final act in a long series of minor distributions. What
distinguishes it from its Boyowan counterparts and the similar
ceremonies among the other Massim, is the accumulation of Kula goods.
In this case, as we have said, the taboo extends also to the valuables.
Immediately after death has occurred in a village, a large stick is
placed on the reef in front of its landing beach, and a conch shell is
tied to it. This is a sign that no visitors will be received who come
to ask for Kula goods. Besides this, a taboo is also imposed on
coco-nut, betel-nut and pigs.</p>
<p>These details, as well as the following ones, I received from an
intelligent and reliable Kitavan informant, who has settled in
Sinaketa. He told me that according to the importance of the death, and
the speed with which the goods were accumulating after a year or so,
word would be sent round to all the partners and <i lang=
"kij">muri-muri</i> (partners once removed). <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb491" href="#pb491" name="pb491">491</a>]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;When all are assembled,&rdquo; my informant
told me, &ldquo;the <i lang="kij">sagali</i> (distribution) begins.
They <i lang="kij">sagali</i> first <i lang="kij">kaulo</i> (yam food),
then <i lang="kij">bulukwa</i> (pig). When pig is plentiful it would be
given in halves; when not, it will be quartered. A big heap of yam
food, of coco-nut, betel-nut, and banana would be placed for each
canoe. Side by side with this row, a row of pig meat would be placed.
One man calls out for the yam heaps, another for the pig-meat; the name
of each canoe is called out. If it were a whole pig, they would say,
&lsquo;<i lang="kij">To&rsquo;uluwa kam visibala!</i>&rsquo;
(To&rsquo;uluwa, your whole pig)! Otherwise they would call out,
&lsquo;<i lang="kij">Mililuta, kami bulukwa!</i>&rsquo; (Men of Liluta,
your pig). And again, &lsquo;<i lang="kij">Mililuta, kami
gogula!</i>&rsquo; (Men of Liluta, your heap). They take it, take their
heap to their canoe. There, the <i lang="kij">toliwaga</i> (master of
the canoe) would make another small <i lang="kij">sagali</i>. Those,
who live near by, singe their meat, and carry it home in their canoes.
Those who live far away, roast the pig, and eat it on the
beach.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be noted that the supreme chief&rsquo;s name would be
uttered when his and his companion&rsquo;s share is allotted. With the
shares of men of less importance, the name of the village is called
out. As on all such occasions, the strangers do not eat their food in
public, and even its re-distribution is done in the privacy of their
camping place near the canoe.</p>
<p>After the distribution of the food, and of course before this is
taken away by the parties, the master of the <i lang=
"kij">so&rsquo;i</i> goes into his house and takes out a specially good
piece of valuable. With a blast of the conch shell, he gives it to the
most distinguished of his partners present. Others follow his example,
and soon the village is filled with conch shell blasts, and all the
members of the community are busy presenting gifts to their partners.
First, the initial gifts (<i lang="kij">vaga</i>) are given, and only
after this is over, such valuables as have been due of old to their
partners, and which have to be given as clinching gifts (<i lang=
"kij">yotile</i>) are handed over.</p>
<p>After the whole public distribution is finished and the guests have
gone, the members of the sub-clan who organised it, at sunset make a
small distribution of their own, called <i lang="kij">kaymelu</i>. With
that the <i lang="kij">so&rsquo;i</i> and the whole period of mourning
and of consecutive distributions, is over. I have said before that this
account of the <i lang="kij">so&rsquo;i</i> has been obtained only
through the statements of several informants, one especially very clear
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb492" href="#pb492" name=
"pb492">492</a>]</span>and reliable. But it has not been checked by
personal observation, and as is always the case with such material,
there is no guarantee of its being complete.</p>
<p>From the point of view in which it interests us, however, that is,
in connection with the Kula, the outstanding fact is well established;
a mortuary taboo temporarily holds up the flow of Kula goods, and a big
quantity of valuables thus dammed up, is suddenly let loose by the
<i lang="kij">so&rsquo;i</i> and spreads in a big wave along the
circuit. The big wave of armshells, for instance, which travelled along
and was taken up by the <i lang="kij">uvalaku</i> expedition of the
Dobuans, was the ripple of a <i lang="kij">so&rsquo;i</i> feast, held
one or two months previously at full moon in Yanabwa, a village of
Woodlark Island. When I was leaving Boyowa, in September, 1918, a
mortuary taboo was in force in the Island of Yeguma, or Egum, as it is
pronounced in the Eastern district (the Alcester Islands of the map).
Kwaywaya, the chief of Kitava whom I met on his visit in Sinaketa, told
me that the people of Yeguma had sent him a sprouting coco-nut, with
the message: &ldquo;When its leaves develop, we shall <i lang=
"kij">sagali</i> (make the distribution).&rdquo; They had kept a
coco-nut at the same stage of development in their village, and sent
others to to all the neighbouring communities. This would give a first
approach in fixing the date, which would be appointed more precisely
when the feast was close at hand.</p>
<p>The custom of associating the <i lang="kij">so&rsquo;i</i> with Kula
is practised as far as Tubetube. In Dobu, there is no distribution of
valuables at the mortuary feast. They have there another custom,
however; at the final mortuary distribution, they like to adorn
themselves with armshells and necklaces of the Kula&mdash;a custom
entirely foreign to the Trobrianders. In Dobu therefore, an approaching
mortuary feast also tends to dam up the valuables<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e20964" title="Not in source">,</span> which<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e20967" title="Not in source">,</span> after its performance<a id=
"xd26e20970" name="xd26e20970"></a> will ebb away in two waves of
<i lang="kij">mwali</i> and <i lang="kij">so&rsquo;ulava</i> along both
branches of the Kula. But they have no custom of distributing these
valuables during the final mortuary feast, and therefore the release of
the <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> would not be as sudden as in a
<i lang="kij">so&rsquo;i</i>.</p>
<p>The same word&mdash;<i lang="kij">so&rsquo;i</i>&mdash;is used to
denote the mortuary festivities over a wide area in the country of the
Massim. Thus, the natives of Bonabona and Su&rsquo;a&rsquo;u, on the
South Coast of New Guinea celebrate annually in November to January
festivities, associated with dancing, gifts of pigs, the building of
new houses, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb493" href="#pb493" name=
"pb493">493</a>]</span>the erection of a platform and several other
features. These feasts, which are held in an inter-connected series
each year in several different localities, I had opportunities, as
mentioned before, to see in three places, but not to study. Whether
they are associated with some form of exchange of valuables I do not
know. Mortuary feasts in other districts of the Massim are also called
<i lang="kij">so&rsquo;i</i>.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20996src"
href="#xd26e20996" name="xd26e20996src">6</a> What is the relation
between these feasts and those of the Northern Massim I am unable to
say.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e20999src" href="#xd26e20999" name=
"xd26e20999src">7</a></p>
<p>These considerations bring us more and more to the point, where the
two branches of the Kula which we have been following up from the
Trobriands Southwards and Eastwards bend back again and meet. On this
remaining part of the Kula, on which my information, however, is
scanty, a few words will be said in the next Chapter. <span class=

<p class="first">In this chapter the ring of the Kula has to be closed
by a description of its remaining portions. It will also be found
indispensable to speak about its offshoots, that is, the trade and the
expeditions, regularly carried on from certain points of the ring to
outlying places. We have come across such offshoots already, when we
realised that the Western Trobriands, especially the village of
Kavataria, and the settlements on the island of Kayleula make non-Kula
trading expeditions to the islands of Fergusson and Goodenough. Such
expeditions would naturally belong to a full picture of the Kula, with
its various associations. This is even more the case, as this lateral
trade is associated with the import and export of some of the Kula
valuables in and out of the ring.</p>
<p>We have brought the description of our Southern expedition as far as
Dawson Straits, and on the Eastern route, we reached Woodlark Island in
the last chapter. We have to link up these two points. The saying, that
a chain is not stronger than its weakest link does not, let us hope,
apply to Ethnology. For indeed my knowledge of the remaining links of
the Kula chain is far less complete than that contained in the previous
chapters. Fortunately, what has been said there, remains true and
valid, whatever might happen in the South-Eastern portion of the Kula.
And again, there is no doubt that the fundamentals of the transaction
are identical all over the ring, though some variations in detail
probably occur. I had the opportunity of questioning informants from
almost every place in the Kula, and the similarity of the main outlines
is established beyond a doubt. Moreover, the information about some
aspect of trade in the Southern Massim district contained in Professor
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb495" href="#pb495" name=
"pb495">495</a>]</span>Seligman&rsquo;s book, entirely, though
indirectly, corroborates my results. But it is necessary to state
emphatically and explicitly that the data given in this chapter are not
in the same category as the rest of the information contained in this
book. The latter was obtained from natives among whom I lived, and the
bulk of it has been controlled and verified by personal experiences and
observations (compare <a href="#table1">Table I</a> in the
Introduction). The material referring to the South Eastern branch was
obtained by cursory examination of natives from that district, whom I
met abroad, not in their own country, whilst I have not been in any of
the places between Woodlark Island and Dobu.</p>
<p>Starting at Woodlark Island, and keeping <a href="#map5">Map V</a>
before our eyes&mdash;we come at once on to an interesting ramification
of the Kula. To the East of Woodlark, lies the coral group of the
Loughlans, inhabited by natives speaking the same language as in
Woodlark. They are in the ring, but it seems to be a <i lang=
"fr">cul-de-sac</i> Kula, for as I was told, the valuables, which go
there<span class="corr" id="xd26e21030" title="Not in source">,</span>
return again to Woodlark. This is quite an unusual complication, a kind
of eddy in the otherwise progressive current. I could not ascertain
whether the difficulty is solved by the districts being sub-divided, a
small ring being formed within it, and each class of articles moving on
it in an opposite direction; or whether some other arrangement has been
adopted. Again, one of my informants told me that some of the <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> went directly from the Loughlans South to
Misima, but I was unable to verify this statement and this whole part
of the Kula must remain with a sketchy outline.</p>
<p>Whatever might be the routes on which the Kula articles travel South
from Woodlark Island, there is no doubt whatever that they all, or
almost all, converge in the important commercial centre of Tubetube.
This small island, according to Professor Seligman, is not even
self-supporting as far as food goes; nor are they a greatly industrial
community. They are to a great extent engaged in trade, and probably
gain part of their support from this activity. &ldquo;Tubetube has
become a trading community, whose inhabitants are recognised as traders
and middlemen over a very considerable area, extending westwards
&hellip; to Rogea and eastward to Murua.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e21038src" href="#xd26e21038" name="xd26e21038src">1</a> Tubetube
is known even in the Trobriands as one of the crucial points of the
Kula, and it is well known that, whatever happens in <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb496" href="#pb496" name="pb496">496</a>]</span>the
small island in the way of mortuary taboos and big feasts will affect
the flow of valuables in Boyowa.</p>
<p>There is no doubt whatever that Tubetube had direct relations with
Murua (to use the Tubetube pronunciation of the native name for
Woodlark Island) to the North-East, and with Dobu to the North-West. I
saw a canoe from the small island beached at Dobu, and in Woodlark I
was told that men from Tubetube used to come there from time to time.
Professor Seligman also describes in detail the manner and the stages
of their sailings to Woodlark Island:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their trade route to Murua &hellip; was, as they made it,
about 120&ndash;135 miles. They would usually go during the monsoon,
and come back on the trade, as those winds served their itinerary best.
Presuming that wind and weather served them throughout the passage,
they slept the first night on an island called Ore, a couple of miles
or so from Dawson Island. The next night they made Panamoti, the third
night they slept at Tokunu (the Alcesters), and by the fourth night,
they might reach Murua.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21050src"
href="#xd26e21050" name="xd26e21050src">2</a> This description reminds
us very much of the route on which we previously had followed the
Sinaketans to Dobu&mdash;the same short stages with intermediate
camping on sandbanks or islands, the same taking advantage of
favourable following winds.</p>

<img src="images/pl64.jpg" alt="Nagega Canoe." width="720" height=

<p class="figureHead">Nagega Canoe.</p>
<p>This type of canoe is manufactured by the North Eastern Massim and
it is used in the South Eastern branch of the Kula. (See <a href=
"#div21.1">Div. I</a> and <a href="#div5.4">Ch. V, Div. IV</a>.)</p>
</div>
<p>From Kitava Eastward as far as Tubetube, a different type of canoe
was used, the <i lang="kij">nagega</i>, mentioned already in <a href=
"#div5.4">Chapter V, Division IV</a>. As we saw there, it was very much
the same in principles of construction as the Trobriand canoe, but it
was bigger, of a greater carrying capacity, and more seaworthy. It was
at the same time slower, but had one great advantage over the swifter
counterpart; having more waterboard, it made less leeway in its
sailing, and could be sailed against the wind. It would thus allow the
natives to cross distances and to face changes in the weather, either
of which would compel the frailer and swifter canoe of Dobu and
Kiriwina to turn back.</p>
<p>To the Northern shores of Normanby Island (Du&rsquo;a&rsquo;u) and
to Dobu, the men of Tubetube would sail with the S.E. trade wind and
return with the blow of the monsoon. According to Professor Seligman,
such a trip to Dobu would take them also about four days, under the
most favourable conditions.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21080src" href=
"#xd26e21080" name="xd26e21080src">3</a> <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb497" href="#pb497" name="pb497">497</a>]</span></p>
<p>Thus, one fundamental fact can be regarded as definitely
established; the main centre of the Kula in its South-Eastern branch,
was the small island of Tubetube. And this island was in direct
communication with two points to which we have followed the Kula in two
directions, starting from the Trobriands; that is, with Dobu and with
Woodlark Island.</p>
<p>On points of detail, some queries must be left unsolved. Were the
visits returned by the Dobuans and Muruans? According to all
probability, yes, but I possess no definite certainty on this
point.</p>
<p>Another question is whether the natives of Tubetube were direct
partners of Murua or Dobu. We have seen that natives of Kiriwina sail
not infrequently to Iwa, Gawa, Kwayawata and even to Woodlark; yet they
are not partners (<i lang="kij">karayta&rsquo;u</i>) of these natives,
but partners once removed (<i lang="kij">murimuri</i>). I have definite
information that the natives of Dobu Island proper and of
Du&rsquo;a&rsquo;u, who, as we remember are not partners of the
Southern Boyowans, stood in direct relation of partnership to the
Tubetube. I believe also that the natives of Woodlark made direct Kula
exchange with those of Tubetube.</p>
<p>The fact, however, that there is a direct line of communication
between Murua-Tubetube-Dobu does not preclude the possibility of other
and more complex routes running parallel with the direct one. Indeed, I
know that the island of Wari, (Teste Island) lying almost due South of
Tubetube is also in the Kula. The big island of Misima (St. Aignan
Island) about a hundred miles East of Tubetube forms also part of the
ring. Thus a much wider circle runs from Woodlark Island, perhaps from
the Loughlans through Misima, the neighbouring small island of
Panayati, Wari, and further West, through the group of islands quite
close to the East end of New Guinea, that is, the islands of Sariba,
Roge&rsquo;a, and Basilaki, and then northwards again towards Normanby
Island. This duplicated circuit in the South-East has its North-Western
counterpart in the double ramification which unites Kitava with Dobu.
The short route runs direct from Kitava to Vakuta and from Vakuta to
Dobu. Besides this, however, there are several longer ones. In one of
them the stages are as follows: Kitava, Okayaulo, or Kitava, Wawela,
thence Sinaketa, then Dobu direct; or <i>via</i> the Amphletts. Another
and still wider ramification would run thus: Kitava, to Kiriwina,
Kiriwina to Sinaketa, etc.; or, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb498"
href="#pb498" name="pb498">498</a>]</span>the widest, Kiriwina to
western Boyowa, then Kayleula, thence Amphletts, and from there to
Dobu. This last route was not only longest in distance, but owing to
the notorious &lsquo;hardness&rsquo; of both the natives of Kayleula
and of the Amphletts, would take up much more time. A glance at Map V,
and also at the more detailed map of the Trobriands (<a href=
"#map4">Map IV</a>) will make all this clear.</p>
<p>A more detailed knowledge of the North-Western routes allowed us to
see the complications and irregularities obtaining there; that the
district of Western Boyowa carried on exclusively the inland Kula, and
that merely in the person of a few headmen of a few villages; that
Kayleula made Kula on a small scale with the communities in the
Amphletts, and that all these, as well as the villages on the Eastern
shore of Southern Boyowa, were what we described as semi-independent
Kula communities. Such details and peculiarities no doubt also exist
with regard to the South-Eastern ramifications of the Kula, but must be
taken here for granted.</p>
<p>Following the various threads further on, I have no doubt that the
islands lying near the East end of New Guinea&mdash;Roge&rsquo;a,
Sariba, Basilaki&mdash;are and were in olden days in the Kula ring,
communicating in the East with Tubetube and Wari, while to the North
they were in contact with the natives of Normanby Island. Whether the
large village complex lying at East Cape was also in the Kula I cannot
definitely say. In any case all the strands led to the Eastern shores
of Dawson Straits, by way of the North-Eastern shores of Normanby
Island. From here, from the district of Dobu, we have traced the
further lines with complete exactness and detail.</p>
<p>Of the various details of these expeditions and technicalities of
the Kula observed in them, I have not much material available. The
rules of actual exchange, the ceremonial of conch blowing, the code of
honour or morality or vanity, perhaps, compelling people to give
equivalent articles for what they have received, all these are the same
all along the ring. So is also the Kula magic, with variations in
details.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One subject on which more must be said is that of the
associated trade. A new and important article of exchange accompanies
the transaction in the South-Eastern branch of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb499" href="#pb499" name="pb499">499</a>]</span>the
Kula: the big, sea-going canoes. The main centres of manufacture, and
to a great extent manufacture for export, were the islands of Gawa and
Panayati. In these places, canoes were constructed for export to the
southern districts where the natives did not know how to build such
canoes (compare <a href="#div1.3">Chapter I, Division III</a>). In
olden days the natives of Woodlark Island, before its present
depopulation, also probably made some canoes for exchange in external
trade. I have seen these canoes owned by natives in the Southern Massim
district as far as Orangerie Bay, over two hundred miles from the place
where they were manufactured. The trading of this article ran along
with the Kula lines of communication as there is no doubt that the
natives of Tubetube and Wari were the main distributors and middlemen
in this trade.</p>
<p>How far canoe exchange was associated directly with Kula
transactions, I cannot say definitely. Judging from the data given by
Professor Seligman,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21128src" href=
"#xd26e21128" name="xd26e21128src">4</a> armshells were paid by natives
of Tubetube for canoes purchased from Panamoti in the North. Thus, the
<i lang="kij">mwali</i> in this commercial transaction, travelled in a
direction opposite to that in which they must move in the Kula ring.
This, again, suggests complete independence of the two transactions.
Besides the canoes, another important article of trade in the southern
portion are the clay pots manufactured both in Tubetube and Wari.
Besides this, the two islands of &ldquo;merchant venturers,&rdquo; as
they are called by Professor Seligman, carry on their Kula expeditions,
and most likely independent of them also, they trade almost all the
various articles of industry manufactured in the neighbouring districts
and distributed by the two communities. This subject has been treated
so fully by Professor Seligman in Chapter XL of his
&ldquo;Melanesians&rdquo; that a reference here will suffice.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e21137src" href="#xd26e21137" name=
"xd26e21137src">5</a></p>
<p>Having now before us the whole ring of the Kula, we may inquire how
far is this ring in contact commercially with other outlying districts,
and, more especially, how far are certain <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb500" href="#pb500" name="pb500">500</a>]</span>articles of trade
imported into it and others drawn out of it? What will interest us most
in this connection is the entry into the ring and the exit out of it of
the articles of Kula proper, the <i lang="kij">mwali</i> (armshells)
and the <i lang="kij">soulava</i> (necklaces).</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">One such offshoot of the Kula ring we met in the
Trobriands, to wit, the expeditions from the Western village of
Kavataria, and from the island of Kayleula, to the Koya of Fergusson
and Goodenough. We shall begin with a brief account of these
expeditions.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21161src" href="#xd26e21161"
name="xd26e21161src">6</a> The preparations are very much the same, as
in Sinaketa. The canoes are built with more or less the same magic (cf.
<a href="#ch5">Chapter V</a>), they are launched ceremonially and the
trial run, the <i lang="kij">tasasoria</i>, also takes place (<a href=
"#ch6">Chapter VI</a>). The island of Kayleula is by far the more
important centre of canoe building. Whether some of the Kavataria
canoes were not actually made in Kayleula and purchased by the
Kavatarians in olden days, I do not definitely know, though I think
this was the case. Nowadays, the community of Kavataria are completely
absorbed by the pearling industry, and since about a generation ago
have given up the expeditions, and even do not own any canoes. The
collecting of trade articles, the magic performed over the <i lang=
"kij">lilava</i>, the <i lang="kij">yawarapu</i>, and the <i lang=
"kij">sulumwoya</i> are the same as those described before (<a href=
"#ch7">Chapter VII</a>) except, that is, that there exists a different
system of <i lang="kij">mwasila</i> in the island of Kayleula, a system
which was used also by the Kavatarians. It must be remembered in this
connection that <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb501" href="#pb501"
name="pb501">501</a>]</span>the natives of Kayleula did make Kula on a
small scale with the Amphlettans, and that their <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i> was connected with the Kula.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e21198src" href="#xd26e21198" name="xd26e21198src">7</a> But the
main object of the Kavatarian and Kayleulan <i lang="kij">mwasila</i>
was their non-Kula trade with the natives of Fergusson and Goodenough.
This is quite clear from Mr. Gilmour&rsquo;s account, and it was also
corroborated by my informants. They told me that the <i lang=
"kij">mwasila</i> is done because of the <i lang=
"kij">kavaylu&rsquo;a</i> (fine food) that is, of the sago and
betel-nut and pigs, the main objects of their expedition:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;If they (the Western Boyowans) would not make
<i lang="kij">mwasila</i>, they (the Western d&rsquo;Entrecasteaux
natives) would fight them. They are foolish men, the people of the
Koya, not like people of Dobu, who are human beings. Those in the Koya
are wild, eaters of man. If they (Kavataria and Kayleula) would make no
<i lang="kij">mwasila</i>, they would refuse them betel-nut, refuse
them sago.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The sailing is characterised by the priority enjoyed by the Kulutula
clan, who, as we have seen in a previous chapter (<a href=
"#div9.3">Chapter IX, Division III</a>) sail ahead and have the
privilege of landing first on any beach, on which they stop. On
arrival, they perform the beauty magic, and sailing towards the beach,
the magic of &ldquo;shaking the mountain&rdquo; is also recited. In the
Koya, the transactions resemble to a certain extent those of the Kula.
As my informant said:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;When they anchor, first of all they give the
<i lang="kij">pari</i>; they give combs, lime pots, wooden dishes, lime
spatul&aelig;, plenty of <i lang="kij">gugu&rsquo;a</i> (objects of
use). At the <i lang="kij">talo&rsquo;i</i> (farewell gifts) this will
be repaid.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The following transaction, the main trade, is carried on as <i lang=
"kij">gimwali</i>. The natives of the Koya would bring the sago, or the
betel-nut, put it on the beach near the canoes and say:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="body">
<div class="div1 chapter">
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;I want a <i lang="kij">beku</i> (ceremonial axe
blade).&rdquo; And here my informants were positive that real
bargaining would take place. &ldquo;If they give us an insufficient
quantity, we <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb502" href="#pb502" name=
"pb502">502</a>]</span>expostulate, then they bring another portion.
They would go to the village, fetch some more goods, return and give it
to us<span class="corr" id="xd26e21263" title="Source: ,">.</span> If
it is enough, we give him the <i lang="kij">beku</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus the barter would be carried on till the visitors had exhausted
their stock in trade and received as much from the local natives as
they could.</p>
<p>These expeditions are interesting in that we see the same type of
magic and a number of similar customs, as in the Kula, associated with
ordinary trading expeditions. I am not certain about the nature of
partnership obtaining in these trading relations, except that Kavataria
and Kayleula have their own districts each with whom they trade.</p>
<p>As said already, the main objects for which they make these distant
trips are sago, betel-nut, pig; also the various feathers, especially
those of the cassowary and the red parrot; rattan-cane belts; plaited
fibre belts; obsidian; fine sand for polishing axe blades; red ochre;
<span class="corr" id="xd26e21276" title=
"Source: pummice">pumice</span> stone; and other products of the jungle
and of the volcanic mountains. For that, they exported to the Koya, to
mention the most valuable first, armshells, the valuable axe blades,
boars&rsquo; tusks and imitations; and, of lesser value, wooden dishes,
combs, lime pots, armlets, baskets, <i lang="kij">wayugo</i> creeper,
mussel shells and lime spatul&aelig; of ebony. Spondylus shell
necklaces were not exported to the Koya.</p>

<div id="div21.4" class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">IV</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Another important activity of the two districts of
Kavataria and Kayleula is their production of armshells. As Sinaketa
and Vakuta are the only two places in the Trobriands where spondylus
discs are made, so Kavataria and Kayleula are the only localities where
the natives fished for the large <i lang="la">Conus millepunctatus</i>
shell, and made out of it the ornaments so highly valued yet so seldom
used. The main reason for the exclusive monopoly, held by these two
places in the manufacture of <i lang="kij">mwali</i>, is the inertia of
custom and usage which traditionally assigns to them this sort of
fishing and manufacture. For the shells are scattered all over the
Lagoon, nor is the fishing and diving for them more difficult than any
of the pursuits practised by all the Lagoon villages. Only the
communities mentioned, however, carry it on, and they only are in
possession of a system of elaborate magic, at least as complex as that
of the <i lang="kij">kaloma</i>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb503"
href="#pb503" name="pb503">503</a>]</span></p>
<p>The actual manufacturing of the armshells presents also no
difficulties. The ornament is made out of a belt of the shell cut out
nearest to its base. With a stone, the natives knock out the circular
base along the rim, and they also knock a circle at some distance from
the base and parallel to it, by which the broad band of shell is
severed, from which the ornament is to be made. It has then to be
polished, and this is done on the outside by rubbing off the soft
calcareous surface on a flat sandstone. The interior is polished off
with a long, cylindrical stone.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e21299src"
href="#xd26e21299" name="xd26e21299src">8</a></p>
<p>It was the custom in Kavataria that when a man found a fine Conus
shell, he would give it to his wife&rsquo;s brother as a <i lang=
"kij">youlo</i> present, who in turn would send the finder a return
present of food, such as specially fine yams, bananas, betel-nut, and
also a pig if it were an especially fine shell. He then would work out
the shell for himself. This arrangement is a pendant to the one
described with reference to Sinaketa, where a man would fish as well as
work out a necklace for one of his wife&rsquo;s kinsmen.</p>
<p>An even more interesting custom obtains in Kayleula. A pair of
shells would be fished and broken in one of the villages of that
island, or in one of its small sister islands, Kuyawa and Manuwata. In
this unfinished state, as a band of coarse shell, called as such
<i lang="kij">makavayna</i>, it is then brought to the Amphletts, and
there given as a Kula gift. The Gumasila man, who receives the shells,
will then polish them up, and in that state again <i lang=
"kij">kula</i> them to Dobu. The Dobuan who receives them then bores
holes in the side, where one rim overlaps the other (clearly to be seen
on <a href="#pl16">Plate XVI</a>) and attaches there the ornaments of
black, wild banana seeds, and spondylus discs. Thus, only after it has
travelled some one hundred miles and passed through two stages of the
Kula, has the <i lang="kij">mwali</i> received its proper shape and
final outfit.</p>
<p>In this manner does a new-born Kula article enter into the ring,
taking shape as it goes through its first few stages, and at the same
time, if it is a specially fine specimen, it is christened <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb504" href="#pb504" name="pb504">504</a>]</span>by
its maker. Some of the names express simply local associations. Thus, a
celebrated pair of <i lang="kij">mwali</i>, of which the shell was
found not long ago by a Kavataria man near the island of Nanoula, is
named after that place. It may be added that, in each pair there is
always a &lsquo;right&rsquo; and a &lsquo;left&rsquo; one, the first
the bigger and more important of the two, and it is after that the name
is given. Of course, they never are found at the same time, but if a
man has succeeded in obtaining a specially fine specimen, he will be
busy trying to find its slightly inferior companion, or some of his
relatives-in-law, friends or kinsmen will give him one.
&lsquo;Nanoula&rsquo; is one of the most celebrated pairs, and it was
known all over the Trobriands, at that moment, that it was soon to come
to Kitava, and the general interest hung round the question who was
going to get it in Boyowa. A pair called &lsquo;Sopimanuwata,&rsquo;
which means, &lsquo;water of Manuwata&rsquo; was found in olden days by
a man of that island close to its shores. Another famous pair, made in
Kayleula, was called &lsquo;Bulivada,&rsquo; after a fish of this name.
The larger shell of this pair was found, according to tradition,
broken, with a hole near its apex. When they brought it to the surface
they found a small <i lang="kij">bulivada</i> fish which had taken up
its abode in the shell. Another pair was called &lsquo;Gomane
ikola,&rsquo; which means &lsquo;it is entangled in a net,&rsquo; as,
according to the story, it was brought up in a net. There are many
other celebrated <i lang="kij">mwali</i>, the names of which are so
familiar that boys and girls are named after them. But the majority of
the names cannot be traced as to their origins.</p>
<p>Another point at which the armshells enter into the ring is Woodlark
Island. I do not know for certain, but I believe that the industry is
quite or almost extinct now in that island. In the olden days, Murua
probably was quite as productive a centre of this manufacture as the
Trobriands, and in these latter though Kayleula and the Western islands
fish and work the <i lang="kij">mwali</i> as much as ever, the natives
of Kavataria are almost entirely out of it, busy all the time diving
for pearls. Both the main places of origin of the armshells, therefore,
are within the Kula ring. After they are made, or, as we saw in
Kayleula, in the process of making, they enter the circulation. Their
entry into the ring is not accompanied by any special rite or custom,
and indeed it does not differ from an ordinary act of exchange. If the
man who found the shell and made the <i lang="kij">mwali</i>
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb505" href="#pb505" name=
"pb505">505</a>]</span>were not in the Kula himself, as might happen in
Kavataria or Kayleula, he would have a relative, a brother-in-law, or a
head man to whom he would give it in the form of one or other of the
many gifts and payments obligatory in this society.</p>

<p class="first">Let us follow the ring of the Kula, noticing its
commercial side tracks, of which so far we only described the trading
routes of Kavataria and Kayleula. To the Eastward, the section from
Kitava to Woodlark Island is the one big portion of the Kula from which
no lateral offshoots issue, and on which all the trade follows the same
routes as the Kula. The other branch, of which I have got a good
knowledge, that from the Trobriands to Dobu, has the commercial
relations of which I have just spoken. The Amphletts, as described in
<a href="#ch11">Chapter XI</a> trade with the natives of Fergusson
Island. The Dobuan-speaking natives from Tewara, Sanaroa, and the
Dawson Straits make exchange, though perhaps not on a very big scale,
with the inland natives of Fergusson. The Dobuan-speaking communities
on Normanby Island, and the natives of Du&rsquo;a&rsquo;u, on the
Northern coast of Normanby, all of whom are in the Kula, trade with the
other natives of Normanby Island who are not in the ring, and with the
natives of the mainland of New Guinea from East Cape Westwards. But,
all this trade affects little the main current of the Kula. From its
main stream, possibly some of the less valuable articles ebb away into
the jungle, which, in its turn, gives its produce to the coast.</p>
<p>The most important leakage out and into the main stream takes place
on the Southern section, mainly at Tubetube and Wari, and at some
points of lesser importance around these two main centres. The North
coast of New Guinea was connected with this district through the
seafaring community at East Cape. But this side branch is of very small
importance as regards the main articles of the Kula. It is the two
connections to East and West, at the extreme southern point of the Kula
ring, which matter most. One of them links up the South Coast of New
Guinea with the Kula ring, the other joins the ring to the big islands
of Sud-Est (Tagula) and Rossel with several adjacent small islands.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb506" href="#pb506" name=
"pb506">506</a>]</span></p>
<p>The South Coast, going from East to West, is at first inhabited by
natives of the Massim stock, speaking the Su&rsquo;a&rsquo;u and
Bonabona dialects. These are in constant intercourse with the Southern
section of the Kula district, that is with the natives of Rogea,
Sariba, Basilaki, Tubetube and Wari. The Massim of the Southern coast
are again in commercial relations with the Mailu, and from this point,
a chain of trading relations unites the Eastern districts with the
Central ones, inhabited by the Motu. The Motu again as we know from
Captain Barton&rsquo;s contribution to Professor Seligman&rsquo;s work,
are in annual trading relations with the Gulf of Papua, so that an
article could travel from the delta of any of the Papuan rivers to
Woodlark in the Trobriands, and many things were in fact traded over
all this distance.</p>
<p>There is, however, one movement which specially interests us from
the Kula point of view, namely that of the two types of Kula valuables.
One of these articles, the armshells, travels on the South Coast from
East to West. There is no doubt that this article leaks out from the
Kula current at its Southernmost point, and is carried away towards
Port Moresby, where the value of armshells is, and was, in olden days
much higher than in the Eastern district. I found in Mailu that the
local native traders purchased, for pigs, armshells in the
Su&rsquo;a&rsquo;u district, and carried them West towards Aroma, Hula,
and Kerepunu. Professor Seligman, from his notes taken at Port Moresby,
informs us that Hula, Aroma, and Kerepunu import armshells into Port
Moresby. Some of these armshells, according to the same authority,
travel further West as far as the Gulf of Papua.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e21361src" href="#xd26e21361" name="xd26e21361src">9</a></p>
<p>It was much more difficult to ascertain what was the direction in
which the spondylus shell necklaces moved on the Southern Coast.
Nowadays, the industry of making these articles, which was once very
highly developed among the Port Moresby natives is partially, though
not completely in decay. I have myself still had the opportunity of
watching the natives of Bo&rsquo;era at work on the <i lang=
"kij">ageva</i>, the very small and fine shell discs, such as the very
finest <i lang="kij">bagi</i> would consist of. They were using in
their manufacture a native pump-drill with a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb507" href="#pb507" name=
"pb507">507</a>]</span>quartz point, in a place within a few miles of a
large white settlement, in a district where white man&rsquo;s influence
on a big scale has been exercised for the last fifty years. Yet, this
is only a vestige of the once extremely developed industry. My
inquiries into this subject could not be exhaustive, for when I worked
on the South Coast, I did not have the problem before me, and on my
second and third expeditions to New Guinea I only passed through Port
Moresby. But I think it may be considered certain that in olden days
the shell strings moved from Port Moresby Eastwards and were introduced
into the Kula ring, at the East end of New Guinea.</p>
<p>However this might be, unquestionable sources of this Kula article
are the islands of Sud-Est, Rossel, and the surrounding small islands.
The best spondylus shell, with the reddest colours is fished in these
seas, and the natives are expert workers of the discs, and export the
finished article to the island of Wari, and, I believe, to the islands
of Misima and Panayati. The most important articles for which the
necklaces are traded are the canoes, and the large polished axe
blades.</p>
<p>Casting now a glance at the Kula ring we see that one class of Kula
article, the <i lang="kij">mwali</i> or armshells, are produced within
the ring at two points, that is, in Woodlark Island and in Western
Boyowa. The other article, that is the <i lang="kij">soulava</i> or
<i lang="kij">bagi</i> (necklaces) are poured into the ring at its
southernmost point. One of these sources (Rossel Island) is still
active, the other (Port Moresby) most probably furnished a good supply
in olden days, but is now disconnected with the Kula ring. The
necklaces produced in Sinaketa are not the real Kula article, and
though they are sometimes exchanged they sooner or later disappear from
the ring according to a sort of Gresham&rsquo;s Law, which operates
here on an article which is not money, and therefore acts in the
opposite sense! The third type of valuable which sometimes flows in the
Kula stream but is not really of it, the large green stone axe blades,
finely polished all over, are, as we know, or more correctly were,
quarried in Woodlark Island, and polished in the district of Kiriwina
in the Trobriands. Another polishing centre is, or was, I believe, the
island of Misima.</p>
<p>We see that the two sources of the <i lang="kij">mwali</i> and
<i lang="kij">soulava</i> are at the Northern and Southern ends of the
ring; the armshells being manufactured in the extreme North, the
necklaces <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb508" href="#pb508" name=
"pb508">508</a>]</span>entering at the Southern end. It is noteworthy
that on the Eastern portion of the ring, on the section
Woodlark-Boyowa-Dobu-Tubetube, the two articles travel in the natural
direction, that is, each is exported from the districts of its origin
towards one, where it is not made or procured. On the other branch,
Woodlark-Yeguma-Tubetube, the current of the Kula is inverse to a
natural, commercial movement of the articles, for here, the Tubetube
people import armshells into Murua, thus bringing coals to Newcastle,
while the Muruans bring necklaces to Tubetube and Wari, that is, to the
points at which the necklaces flow into the ring from the outside.
These considerations are important for anyone who would like to reflect
on the origins, or history of the Kula, since the natural movement of
valuables was no doubt the original one, and the Western half of the
Kula from this point of view appears to be the older.</p>
<p>But here we have come to an end of all the descriptive data
referring to the Kula, and some general remarks which I have to make
upon it, will be reserved for the next and last chapter. <span class=

cannot follow Professor Seligman in his use of the word
<i>currency</i>, which is not very clearly defined by him. This word
can be correctly applied to the armshells, spondylus discs, big
polished blades of green stones, etc., only if we give it simply the
meaning of &ldquo;objects&rdquo; or &ldquo;tokens of wealth.&rdquo;
<i>Currency</i> as a rule means a medium of exchange and standard of
value, and none of the Massim valuables fulfil these
functions.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd26e21137src">&uarr;</a></p>
<p class="footnote"><span class="label"><a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e21161" href="#xd26e21161src" name="xd26e21161">6</a></span> A
short article on this subject has been published by the Rev. M.
Gilmour, now head of the Methodist Mission in New Guinea. (Annual
Report of British New Guinea, 1904&ndash;5, p. 71.) I used this article
in the field, going over it with several natives of Kavataria, and I
found it substantially correct, and on the whole formulated with
precision. The need for extreme compression of statement has, however,
led the Author into one or two ambiguities. Thus, the constant mention
of &ldquo;feasting&rdquo; might give a wrong impression, for it is
always the matter of a public distribution of food, which is then eaten
apart, or in small groups, while the word &ldquo;feast&rdquo; suggests
eating in common. Again, the data about the &ldquo;sea-chief,&rdquo; as
Mr. Gilmour calls the leader of the privileged clan in Kavataria (cf.
<a href="#div9.3">Chapter IX, Division III</a>), seemed to me
over-stated, when he is said to be &ldquo;supreme,&rdquo; to have
&ldquo;the right of determining an expedition,&rdquo; and especially
when it is said that he &ldquo;had the right of first choice of a
canoe.&rdquo; This latter phrase must involve a misunderstanding; as we
saw, each sub-clan (that is, each sub-division of the village) build
their own canoe, and a subsequent swapping and free choice are out of
the question. Mr. Gilmour was fully acquainted with the facts of the
Kula, as I learnt from personal conversation. In this article, he
mentions it only in one phrase, saying that some of the expeditions
&ldquo;were principally concerned in the exchange of the circulated
articles of native wealth &hellip; in which trade was only a secondary
consideration.&rdquo;&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

Gilmour&rsquo;s statement to the contrary namely that &ldquo;the trips
from the West&mdash;Kavataria and Kaileuna&mdash;were pure trading
expeditions&rdquo; (<i>loc. cit</i>.)&mdash;is incorrect. First, I am
inclined to think that some of the Kavataria men did make the Kula in
the Amphletts, where they always stopped on their way South, but this
might have been only on a very small scale, and entirely overshadowed
by the main object of the expedition, which was the trade with the
Southern Koya. Secondly, as to the natives of Kayleula, I am certain
that they made the Kula, from conclusive data collected both in the
Trobriands and in the Amphletts.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href=

have given a more detailed description of this process which I had
often opportunities to observe among the Mailu on the South coast. I
never saw the making of an armshell in the Trobriands, but the two
processes are identical according to detailed information which I
obtained. (Compare the monograph on &ldquo;The Natives of Mailu&rdquo;

<div class="divHead">
<h2 class="label">Chapter XXII</h2>
<h2 class="main">The Meaning of the Kula</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We have been following the various routes and
ramifications of the Kula, entering minutely and meticulously into its
rules and customs., its beliefs and practices, and the mythological
tradition spun round it, till, arriving at the end of our information,
we have made its two ends meet. We shall now put aside the magnifying
glass of detailed examination and look from a distance at the subject
of our inquiry, take in the whole institution with one glance, let it
assume a definite shape before us. This shape will perhaps strike us as
being something unusual, something not met before in ethnological
studies. It will be well to make an attempt at finding its place among
the other subjects of systematic ethnology, at gauging its
significance, at assessing how much we have learned by becoming
acquainted with it.</p>
<p>After all there is no value in isolated facts for science, however
striking and novel they might seem in themselves. Genuine scientific
research differs from mere curio-hunting in that the latter runs after
the quaint, singular and freakish&mdash;the craving for the sensational
and the mania of collecting providing its twofold stimulus. Science on
the other hand has to analyse and classify facts in order to place them
in an organic whole, to incorporate them in one of the systems in which
it tries to group the various aspects of reality.</p>
<p>I shall not, of course enter upon any speculations or add any
hypothetical assumptions to the empirical data contained in the
foregoing chapters. I shall confine myself to some reflections on the
most general aspect of the institution, and try to express somewhat
more clearly what to me appears the mental attitude at the bottom of
the various Kula customs. These general points of view ought, I think,
to be considered and tested in further field-work done on subjects akin
to the Kula <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb510" href="#pb510" name=
"pb510">510</a>]</span>as well as in theoretical research, and might
thus prove fertile for future scientific work. In this form it may be
granted that it is the privilege of the chronicler of a novel
phenomenon to pass it over to the consideration of fellow-workers; but
it is his duty as well as his privilege. For, apart from his first-hand
acquaintance with the facts&mdash;and indeed, if his account is good,
he ought to have succeeded in transferring the best part of his
knowledge to the reader&mdash;the fundamental aspects and
characteristics of an ethnographic phenomenon for being general are
none the less empirical. It is therefore the Chronicler&rsquo;s task to
finish his account by a comprehensive, synthetic <i lang="fr">coup
d&rsquo;&oelig;il</i> upon the institution described.</p>
<p>As said the Kula seems to be, to a certain extent, a novel type of
ethnological fact. Its novelty lies partly in the size of its
sociological and geographical extent. A big, inter-tribal relationship,
uniting with definite social bonds a vast area and great numbers of
people, binding them with definite ties of reciprocal obligations,
making them follow minute rules and observations in a concerted
manner&mdash;the Kula is a sociological mechanism of surpassing size
and complexity, considering the level of culture on which we find it.
Nor can this wide network of social co-relations and cultural
influences be considered for a moment as ephemeral, new or precarious.
For its highly developed mythology and its magical ritual show how
deeply it has taken root in the tradition of these natives and of what
ancient growth it must be.</p>
<p>Another unusual feature is the character of the transaction itself,
which is the proper substance of the Kula. A half commercial, half
ceremonial exchange, it is carried out for its own sake, in fulfilment
of a deep desire to possess. But here again, it is not ordinary
possession, but a special type, in which a man owns for a short time,
and in an alternating manner, individual specimens of two classes of
objects. Though the ownership is incomplete in point of permanency, it
is in turn enhanced in point of numbers successively possessed, and may
be called a cumulative possession.</p>
<p>Another aspect of great, perhaps the greatest, importance and which
perhaps reveals best the unusual character of the Kula is the
natives&rsquo; mental attitude towards the tokens of wealth. These
latter are neither used nor regarded as money or currency, and they
resemble these economic instruments <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb511" href="#pb511" name="pb511">511</a>]</span>very little, if
indeed there is any resemblance at all, except that both money and
<i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> represent condensed wealth. <i lang=
"kij">Vaygu&rsquo;a</i> is never used as medium of exchange or as
measure of value, which are the two most important functions of
currency or money. Each piece of <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> of the
Kula type has one main object throughout its existence&mdash;to be
possessed and exchanged; has one main function and serves one main
purpose&mdash;to circulate round the Kula ring, to be owned and
displayed in a certain manner, of which we shall speak presently. And
the exchange which each piece of <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>
constantly undergoes is of a very special kind; limited in the
geographical direction in which it can take place, narrowly
circumscribed in the social circle of men between whom it may be done,
it is subject to all sorts of strict rules and regulations; it can
neither be described as barter, nor as simply giving and receiving of
presents, nor in any sense is it a play at exchange. In fact it is
<i lang="kij">Kula</i>, an exchange of an entirely novel type. And it
is just through this exchange, through their being constantly within
reach and the object of competitive desire, through being the means of
arousing envy and conferring social distinction and renown, that these
objects attain their high value. Indeed, they form one of the leading
interests in native life, and are one of the main items in the
inventory of their culture. Thus, one of the most important and unusual
features of the Kula is the existence of the Kula <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, the incessantly circulating and ever
exchangeable valuables, owing their value to this very circulation and
its character.</p>
<p>The acts of exchange of the valuables have to conform to a definite
code. The main tenet of this declares that the transaction is not a
bargain. The equivalence of the values exchanged is essential, but it
must be the result of the repayer&rsquo;s own sense of what is due to
custom and to his own dignity. The ceremonial attached to the act of
giving, the manner of carrying and handling the <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> shows distinctly that this is regarded as
something else than mere merchandise. Indeed it is to the native
something that confers dignity, that exalts him, and which he therefore
treats with veneration and affection. Their behaviour at the
transaction, makes it clear that the <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> is
regarded, not only as possessing high value, but that it is treated
also in a ritual manner, and arouses emotional reaction. This
recognition is confirmed and deepened by the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb512" href="#pb512" name=
"pb512">512</a>]</span>consideration of some other uses of <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, in which uses other valuables, such as
<i lang="kij">kaloma</i> belts and large stone blades also function,
besides the Kula articles.</p>
<p>Thus, when a malignant spirit, <i lang="kij">tauva&rsquo;u</i> (see
<a href="#div2.7">Chapter II, Division VII</a>) is found in or near the
village in the shape of a snake or a land crab, some <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> is put before it ceremonially and this is not
done so much in order to bribe the spirit sacrificially by a gift as
rather to exercise a direct action on his mind, and to make it
benevolent. In the annual festive and dancing period, the <i lang=
"kij">milamala</i>, the spirits return to their villages. The Kula
valuables at that time in the hands of the community, as well as the
permanent <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>, such as stone blades,
<i lang="kij">kaloma</i> belts, and <i lang="kij">doga</i> pendants,
are exhibited sacrificially to the spirits on a platform, an
arrangement and custom called <i lang="kij">yolova</i> (compare
<a href="#div2.7">Chapter II, Division VII</a>). Thus the <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> represent the most effective offering to be
given to the spirits, through which they can be put into a pleasant
state of mind; &ldquo;to make their minds good,&rdquo; as the
stereotyped phrase of the natives runs. In the <i lang="kij">yolova</i>
an offering is made to the spirits of what is most valued by the
living. The shadowy visitors are supposed to take the spirit or shadow
part of the <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> home, and make a <i lang=
"kij">tanarere</i> of it on the beach of Tuma, just as a Kula party
make a <i lang="kij">tanarere</i> of the acquired valuables on their
home beach (cf. <a href="#div15.4">Chapter XV, Division IV</a>). In all
this there is a clear expression of the mental attitude of the natives,
who regard the <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> as supremely good in
themselves, and not as convertible wealth, or as potential ornaments,
or even as instruments of power. To possess <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> is exhilarating, comforting, soothing in
itself. They will look at <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> and handle it
for hours; even a touch of it imparts under circumstances its
virtue.</p>
<p>This is most clearly expressed by a custom observed at death. A
dying man is surrounded and overlaid with valuables which all his
relatives and relatives-in-law bring in loan for the occasion, to take
it back when all is over while the man&rsquo;s own <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> are left on the corpse for some time after
death (see <a href="#pl65">Plate LXV</a>). Various rationalised
versions and justifications of this custom are given. Thus it is said
to be a gift to Topileta, the keeper of the nether world; or, again,
that it has to be taken in its spiritual form to procure a high social
standing in Tuma, or simply, that it is laid to adorn and make happier
the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb513" href="#pb513" name=
"pb513">513</a>]</span>last moments of the dying. All these beliefs no
doubt exist side by side, and they are all compatible with, and indeed
express, the underlying emotional attitude; the comforting action of
the valuables. It is applied to the dying as something full of good, as
something exercising a pleasant action, soothing and fortifying at the
same time. They put it on his forehead, they put it on his chest, they
rub his belly and his ribs with it, they dangle some of the <i lang=
"kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> before his nose. I have often seen them do
that, in fact, observed them do it for hours, and I believe there is a
complex, emotional and intellectual attitude at the bottom of it; the
desire to inspire with life; and at the same time to prepare for death;
to hold him fast to this one, and to equip for the other world; but
above all, the deep feeling that the <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>
are the supreme comfort, that to surround a man with them, even in his
most evil moment, makes this moment less evil. The same mental attitude
is probably at the bottom of the custom which prescribes that the
widow&rsquo;s brothers should give a <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> to
the brothers of the dead man, the same <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>
being given back on the same day. But it is kept just long enough to be
of comfort to those, who, according to native kinship ideas, are most
directly hit by the death.</p>

<img src="images/pl65.jpg" alt="A Corpse Covered with Valuables."
width="556" height="463">
<p class="figureHead">A Corpse Covered with Valuables.</p>
<p>A great number of valuables, including large axe blades, with which
this man was covered at dying, have been already withdrawn. Only
personal possessions are left on the corpse, and they will be removed
immediately before the interment.</p>
</div>
<p>In all this we find the expression of the same mental attitude, the
extreme value attached to condensed wealth, the serious, respectful way
of treating it, the idea and the feeling that it is the reservoir of
highest good. The <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> are valued in quite a
different manner from that in which we value our wealth. The Biblical
symbol of the golden calf might even be better applied to their
attitude than to ours, although it would be not quite correct to say
that they &lsquo;worship&rsquo; the <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i>,
for they worship nothing. The <i lang="kij">vaygu&rsquo;a</i> might
perhaps be called &ldquo;objects of cult&rdquo; in the sense expressed
by the facts of the Kula, and the data just adduced; that is, in so far
as they are handled ritually in some of the most important acts of
native life.</p>
<p>Thus, in several aspects, the Kula presents to us a new type of
phenomenon, lying on the borderland between the commercial and the
ceremonial and expressing a complex and interesting attitude of mind.
But though it is novel, it can hardly be unique. For we can scarcely
imagine that a social phenomenon on such a scale, and obviously so
deeply connected with fundamental layers of human nature, should only
be a sport and a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb514" href="#pb514"
name="pb514">514</a>]</span>freak, found in one spot of the earth
alone. Once we have found this new type of ethnographic fact, we may
hope that similar or kindred ones will be found elsewhere. For the
history of our science shows many cases in which a new type of
phenomena having been discovered, taken up by theory, discussed and
analysed, was found subsequently all the world over. The <i lang=
"xx">tabu</i>, the Polynesian word and the Polynesian custom, has
served as prototype and eponym to similar regulations found among all
the savage and barbarous as well as civilised races. Totemism, found
first among one tribe of North American Indians and brought to light by
the work of Frazer, has later on been documented so widely and fully
from everywhere, that in re-writing his early small book, its historian
could fill out four volumes. The conception of <i lang="kij">mana</i>,
discovered in a small Melanesian community has, by the work of Hubert
and Mauss, Marett and others, been proved of fundamental importance,
and there is no doubt that <i lang="kij">mana</i>, whether named or
unnamed, figures and figures largely in the magical beliefs and
practices of all natives. These are the most classical and best known
examples, and they could be multiplied by others were it necessary.
Phenomena of the &lsquo;totemic type&rsquo; or of the &lsquo;mana
type&rsquo; or of the &lsquo;tabu type&rsquo; are to be found in all
ethnographic provinces, since each of these concepts stands for a
fundamental attitude of the savage towards reality.</p>
<p>So with the Kula, if it represents a novel, but not freakish,
indeed, a fundamental type of human activity and of the mental attitude
of man, we may expect to find allied and kindred phenomena in various
other ethnographic provinces. And we may be on the lookout for economic
transactions, expressing a reverential, almost worshipping attitude
towards the valuables exchanged or handled; implying a novel type of
ownership, temporary, intermittent, and cumulative; involving a vast
and complex social mechanism and systems of economic enterprises, by
means of which it is carried out. Such is the Kula type of
semi-economic, semi-ceremonial activities. It would be futile, no
doubt, to expect that exact replicas of this institution should be
found anywhere and with the same details, such as the circular path on
which the valuables move, the fixed direction in which each class has
to travel, and existence of solicitory and intermediate gifts. All
these technicalities are important and interesting, but they are
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb515" href="#pb515" name=
"pb515">515</a>]</span>probably connected in one way or another with
the special local conditions of the Kula. What we can expect to find in
other parts of the world are the fundamental ideas of the Kula, and its
social arrangements in their main outline, and for these the
field-worker might be on the look-out.</p>
<p>For the theoretical student, mainly interested in problems of
evolution, the Kula might supply some reflections about the origins of
wealth and value, of trade and economic relations in general. It might
also shed some light upon the development of ceremonial life, and upon
the influence of economic aims <span class="corr" id="xd26e21582"
title="Source: and and">and</span> ambitions upon the evolution of
intertribal intercourse and of primitive international law. For the
student mainly viewing the problems of Ethnology from the point of view
of the contact of cultures, and interested in the spread of
institutions, beliefs and objects by transmission, the Kula is no less
important. Here is a new type of inter-tribal contact, of relations
between several communities slightly but definitely differing in
culture, and a relation not spasmodic or accidental but regulated and
permanent. Quite apart from the fact that in trying to explain how the
Kula relationship between the various tribes originated, we are
confronted with a definite problem of culture contact.</p>
<p>These few remarks must suffice, as I cannot enter into any
theoretical speculations myself. There is one aspect of the Kula,
however, to which attention must be drawn from the point of view of its
theoretical importance. We have seen that this institution presents
several aspects closely intertwined and influencing one another. To
take only two, economic enterprise and magical ritual form one
inseparable whole, the forces of the magical belief and the efforts of
man moulding and influencing one another. How this is happening has
been described before in detail in the previous chapters.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e21587src" href="#xd26e21587" name=
"xd26e21587src">1</a></p>
<p>But it seems to me that a deeper analysis and comparison of the
manner in which two aspects of culture functionally depend on one
another might afford some interesting material for theoretical
reflection. Indeed, it seems to me that there is room for a new type of
theory. The succession in time, and the influence of the previous stage
upon the subsequent, is the main subject of evolutional studies, such
as are practised by the classical school of British Anthropology
(Tylor, Frazer, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb516" href="#pb516"
name="pb516">516</a>]</span>Westermarck, Sydney Hartland, Crawley). The
ethnological school (Ratzel, Foy, Gr&auml;bner, W. Schmidt, Rivers, and
Eliott-Smith) studies the influence of cultures by contact,
infiltration and transmission. The influence of environment on cultural
institutions and race is studied by anthropo-geography (Ratzel and
others). The influence on one another of the various aspects of an
institution, the study of the social and psychological mechanism on
which the institution is based, are a type of theoretical studies which
has been practised up till now in a tentative way only, but I venture
to foretell will come into their own sooner or later. This kind of
research will pave the way and provide the material for the others.</p>
<p>At one or two places in the previous chapters, a somewhat detailed
digression was made in order to criticise the view about the economic
nature of primitive man, as it survives in our mental habits as well as
in some text books&mdash;the conception of a rational being who wants
nothing but to satisfy his simplest needs and does it according to the
economic principle of least effort. This economic man always knows
exactly where his material interests lie, and makes for them in a
straight line. At the bottom of the so-called materialistic conception
of history lies a somewhat analogous idea of a human being, who, in
everything he devises and pursues, has nothing but his material
advantage of a purely utilitarian type at heart. Now I hope that
whatever the meaning of the Kula might be for Ethnology, for the
general science of culture, the meaning of the Kula will consist in
being instrumental to <span class="corr" id="xd26e21599" title=
"Source: dispell">dispel</span> such crude, rationalistic conceptions
of primitive mankind, and to induce both the speculator and the
observer to deepen the analysis of economic facts. Indeed, the Kula
shows us that the whole conception of primitive value; the very
incorrect habit of calling all objects of value &lsquo;money&rsquo; or
&lsquo;currency&rsquo;; the current ideas of primitive trade and
primitive ownership&mdash;all these have to be revised in the light of
our institution.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this book, in the Introduction, I, in a way,
promised the reader that he should receive a vivid impression of the
events enabling him to see them in their native perspective, at the
same time without for one moment losing sight of the method by which I
have obtained my data. I have tried to present everything as far as
possible in terms of concrete fact, letting the natives speak for
themselves, perform <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb517" href="#pb517"
name="pb517">517</a>]</span>their transactions, pursue their activities
before the reader&rsquo;s mental vision. I have tried to pave my
account with fact and details, equip it with documents, with figures,
with instances of actual occurrence. But at the same time, my
conviction, as expressed over and over again, is that what matters
really is not the detail, not the fact, but the scientific use we make
of it. Thus the details and technicalities of the Kula acquire their
meaning in so far only as they express some central attitude of mind of
the natives, and thus broaden our knowledge, widen our outlook and
deepen our grasp of human nature.</p>
<p>What interests me really in the study of the native is his outlook
on things, his <i lang="de">Weltanschauung</i>, the breath of life and
reality which he breathes and by which he lives. Every human culture
gives its members a definite vision of the world, a definite zest of
life. In the roamings over human history, and over the surface of the
earth, it is the possibility of seeing life and the world from the
various angles, peculiar to each culture, that has always charmed me
most, and inspired me with real desire to penetrate other cultures, to
understand other types of life.</p>
<p>To pause for a moment before a quaint and singular fact; to be
amused at it, and see its outward strangeness; to look at it as a curio
and collect it into the museum of one&rsquo;s memory or into
one&rsquo;s store of anecdotes&mdash;this attitude of mind has always
been foreign and repugnant to me. Some people are unable to grasp the
inner meaning and the psychological reality of all that is outwardly
strange, at first sight incomprehensible, in a different culture. These
people are not born to be ethnologists. It is in the love of the final
synthesis, achieved by the assimilation and comprehension of all the
items of a culture and still more in the love of the variety and
independence of the various cultures that lies the test of the real
worker in the true Science of Man.</p>
<p>There is, however, one point of view deeper yet and more important
than the love of tasting of the variety of human modes of life, and
that is the desire to turn such knowledge into wisdom. Though it may be
given to us for a moment to enter into the soul of a savage and through
his eyes to look at the outer world and feel ourselves what it must
feel to <i>him</i> to be himself&mdash;yet our final goal is to enrich
and deepen our own <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb518" href="#pb518"
name="pb518">518</a>]</span>world&rsquo;s vision, to understand our own
nature and to make it finer, intellectually and artistically. In
grasping the essential outlook of others, with the reverence and real
understanding, due even to savages, we cannot but help widening our
own. We cannot possibly reach the final Socratic wisdom of knowing
ourselves if we never leave the narrow confinement of the customs,
beliefs and prejudices into which every man is born. Nothing can teach
us a better lesson in this matter of ultimate importance than the habit
of mind which allows us to treat the beliefs and values of another man
from his point of view. Nor has civilised humanity ever needed such
tolerance more than now, when prejudice, ill will and vindictiveness
are dividing each European nation from another, when all the ideals,
cherished and proclaimed as the highest achievements of civilisation,
science and religion, have been thrown to the winds. The Science of
Man, in its most refined and deepest version should lead us to such
knowledge and to tolerance and generosity, based on the understanding
of other men&rsquo;s point of view.</p>
<p>The study of Ethnology&mdash;so often mistaken by its very votaries
for an idle hunting after curios, for a ramble among the savage and
fantastic shapes of &ldquo;barbarous customs and crude
superstitions&rdquo;&mdash;might become one of the most deeply
philosophic, enlightening and elevating disciplines of scientific
research. Alas! the time is short for Ethnology, and will this truth of
its real meaning and importance dawn before it is too late?

<p class="first">Bronis&#322;aw Kasper Malinowski, (1884&ndash;1942)
was a British anthropologist of Polish descent. Born in Krak&oacute;w,
Poland, he studied at the Jagiellonian University, Krak&oacute;w, and
in Leipzig. He moved to London in 1910. In 1914 Malinowski took part in
an expedition to New Guinea and Melanesia and spent the next four years
studying the people of the Trobriand Islands of the Southwest Pacific.
He began teaching at the University of London in 1924 and became
professor of social anthropology in 1927. Between 1939 and 1942 he was
a visiting professor at Yale University. He was the founder of
functionalism, a school in anthropology which maintains that cultures
should be studied in terms of their particular internal dynamics.</p>
<p>This book, a classic in anthropology, describes in great detail the
Kula system of the Trobriand Islands in New Guinea. In the Kula,
valuables are circulated among the various islands in a complicated,
ceremonial way. This system is a kind of &ldquo;gift&rdquo; culture, in
which status is not obtained from the possession of material objects,
but by handling them or giving them away, similar to the potlatch of
the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of Canada and the
United States. This also has some relevance to the modern &ldquo;Open
Source&rdquo; movement.</p>
<p>The book itself had a huge impact on anthropology, because of
Malinowski&rsquo;s at that time novel approach of anthropological
research, in which the author immersed himself in the culture he
studied, using informal interviews, direct observation, participation
in the life of the group, and collective discussions.</p>
